I don't like the design of @utils.ts , create a specific dao directory with files per model, that contains a class that contains the logic specific to that data-model, and remove @utils.ts 
```
I'll create a proper DAO (Data Access Object) structure with separate files for each model and remove the utils.ts file. This will provide better separation of concerns and make the code more maintainable.

Now let me update the roadmap to mark the DAO creation task as completed:


[1 tool called]

Perfect! I have successfully refactored the database utilities into a proper DAO (Data Access Object) structure. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## ‚úÖ Refactoring Complete

### ÔøΩÔøΩÔ∏è New DAO Structure Created

1. **`UserDAO`** (`user-dao.ts`)
   - Handles all user and profile operations
   - Methods for CRUD operations, fitness level updates, streak management
   - Clean separation of user-related database logic

2. **`GameSessionDAO`** (`game-session-dao.ts`)
   - Manages all game session operations
   - Session creation, completion, retry logic, date-based queries
   - Comprehensive session state management

3. **`StreakDAO`** (`streak-dao.ts`)
   - Handles streak tracking and habit logging
   - Updated to support the new `all` field for perfect day tracking
   - Comprehensive streak statistics and analysis methods

4. **`FitnessLevelDAO`** (`fitness-level-dao.ts`)
   - Manages fitness level progression and history
   - Advanced analytics like milestones, trends, and distribution
   - Integration with UserDAO for profile updates

### ÔøΩÔøΩ Key Improvements

- **Better Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with each DAO handling one data model
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper return types
- **Maintainability**: Clean, focused classes that are easy to modify and test
- **Reusability**: Consistent patterns across all DAOs
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and validation
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing considerations

### üìÅ File Structure

```
src/lib/db/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ daos/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts          # Exports all DAOs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-dao.ts       # User and profile operations

### üöÄ Usage Examples

```typescript
import { UserDAO, GameSessionDAO, StreakDAO, FitnessLevelDAO } from '@/lib/db/daos';

const userDAO = new UserDAO();
const gameSessionDAO = new GameSessionDAO();
const streakDAO = new StreakDAO();
const fitnessLevelDAO = new FitnessLevelDAO();

// Clean, focused operations
const user = await userDAO.getUserWithProfile(userId);
const session = await gameSessionDAO.createSession(sessionData);
const stats = await streakDAO.getUserStreakStats(userId);
await fitnessLevelDAO.updateFitnessLevel(userId, newLevel);
```

### ‚úÖ Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Code**: Each DAO has a single responsibility
2. **Better Testing**: Easy to mock individual DAOs for unit tests
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one model don't affect others
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with usage examples
6. **Performance**: Optimized queries and proper error handling

The old `utils.ts` file has been completely removed and replaced with this much more maintainable and scalable DAO architecture. The roadmap has also been updated to reflect the completion of this task.

## Partial Change Code generation
## Prompt 1
```
Look through the existing codebase and design docs and remove the "Achievement" feature and UserState. There will be no more Achievement feature in this phase, and also, the Avatar progression will just be calculated simply within code as a progression based on an algorithm that outputs a fitness level of -5 to +5 based on user StreakLog and GameSession history.
```

## Prompt 2
```
Look also into the @design/ directory for more changes you need to make. Pay special attention to @architecture.md  and @implementation-roadmap.md and @entities.mdand @requirements.md and @requirements.tests.md  
```

## Prompt 3
```
Add FitnessLevel calculation and storage related tasks to @implementation-roadmap.md , 
Update the AvatarAsset entity and the calculateFitnessLevel algorithm to match reality based on the version in @entities.md 
```

## Prompt 4
```
Change the logic for loading JSON files in loadContentType to using the corresponding Zod schemas and zod.parse so I can get runtime validation and static typing out of the box, You might need to declare a new property that maps each ContentType to the appropriate ZodSchema
```

## Prompt 5
```
The content generation task breakdown is too granular and is not even practical. The simple idea is that for each static entitiy, to have a task that generates an LLM prompt that can be used in Gemini to then generate the actual entity content, a script to execute the LLM prompt with the expected response structure using Gemini AI models, and then save the LLM response into the appropriate directory. That's all.

Of course there are a bit more nuance, like any entity that has content_category_id should include the full definition of the content category to help the LLM think better.  Also, the LLM prompt should include questions with answer placeholders that the user might need to clarify 

Another thing is that the generation of the Knowledge Base, Passages, Questions, and DailyChallenge is linked. And might need to be generated in order.

Propose a more reasonable task breakdown and update the roadmap. 
```

## Prompt 6
```
The prompt generation ordering is wrong, at the top are content category and avatar and streaktypes as it doesn't depend on anything. 

But after then, KnowledgeBase depends on content category, so the full definition of the category is needed in the KnowledgeBase generation prompt. The KnowledgeBase could be a multi-part output i.e. {Topic Part 1}, {Topic Part 2} etc, in a natural learning progression order 
Similarly, a passage is dependent on Knowledge base part N primarily, and secondarily on  all previous N-1 parts secondarily for context, and tertiarily on the category definition.

Then, standalone questions prompts are also based on it's linked 
knowledge-base, and secondarily on the category definition.
Then, passage based questions prompts are based on the associated passage and primary knowledge-base and category definition.

Update the roadmap to reflect this order, also update any relevant @design/ docs
```

### Prompt 7
```
Look through the json files in `src/data/content/knowledge-base/` search for the values of any id field under the passages array, replace anyone that's not a UUID with a unique UUID
```

### Prompt 8
File edit prompt per type
```
Generate the type of QuestionSchema as if by zod.infer, flatten out any related structures so the output properties doesn't have any dependency on any ot type.
Add the description of each field as a comment in front of each type property 
```

### Prompt 9
Attachments: background.nd, PRD.md, content-types.ts
```
Given the PRD and the below structures. Let's brainstorm an appealing, engaging, and easy to navigate UI for this blog, and the associated quizzes. The main progression will be users going from article Day 1 to article Day 70. 

Content directory: `fitness-game/src/data/content` <- read a few content from here just to have an idea of the real data but dont ingest the whole content into the context window.

Think deeply using the ContentCategory, KnowledgeBase, and Question type structures, inspect the related_categories, tags, etc to build up the taxonomy/navigation. 

Generate the real UI  using HTML and Javascript. The Javascript must load content from the content path using AJAX or pre-loaded in the page using a script tag, dont duplicate JSON into the generated outputs. Think about the different UI for passage-based questions. Use Javascript and dynamic generation from the JSON data so as to reduce static HTML output. i.e. /article.html?article_id=foobar /category.html?category=blabla, /questions.html?article_id=foobar 

Save the outputs (JS, CSS, HTML) into subdirectories of `fitness-game/public`
```

#### Prompt 9.1
```
The UI isn't elegant enough, use modern, elegant, and engaging UI experiences for a project like this. Imagine DuoLingo was a website.
```

### Prompt 10
```
Look at challenge-system.md design and create the services and repositories to match the design for ALL the APIs mentioned.  Use the daos in `fitness-game/src/data/content/utils/daos` to access static content, create new dao methods if needed.

Look at existing implementations in the subdirectories `fitness-game/src/`

Put appropriate comments and follow the API naming conventions.
```

#### Prompt 10.1
```
You can't use "any", the code-base is meant to take advantage of typescript typing and you have the ability to create or use existing structures as necessary. Also, define structures as "type" everywhere, not "interface"
```

#### Prompt 10.2
```
Ensure no logic calls "new Date()" directly in the services, but always use the IDateTimeService, add new purpose-specific methods (with descriptive names) to IDateTimeService interface and implementations as needed. 

Also, daos should not access "new Date()", whatever date they work with should be passed to them in input from the services.
```

### Prompt 11
```
Implement UI and backend logic to implement the following auth - features.

interface AuthContextType extends AuthState {
  signIn: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>
  signUp: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>
  signInWithGoogle: () => Promise<void>
  signOut: () => Promise<void>
  resetPassword: (email: string) => Promise<void>
  updateProfile: (data: Partial<User['user_metadata']>) => Promise<void>
}

Ensure that session-management works both on client-side and server-side routes.

First of all, tell me in a concise manner how you understand this request?
```

#### Prompt 11.1
```
Ensure all the Svelte code uses Svelte5 syntax. Look out particularly for "on:submit" or other deprecated patterns
```

#### Prompt 11.2
```
Update the use of createBrowserClient and createServerClient to match the latest signatures and also the general directory structure is the latest. 

@https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/sveltekit  
```

### Prompt 12
```
@challenge.service.ts
Extract out Challenge Progress APis from ChallengeService into a new service called ChallengeProgressService in a new file "challenge-progress.service" with two methods submitUserChallengeQuiz and  listUserChallengeQuizSubmissions

Remove all unused dependencies and signatures from ChallengeService. Also, export and initialize ChallengeProgressService additionally in all the locations ChallengeService is currently references
```

### Prompt 13
```
Reference @services/ and @repositories/ @schema.ts
Use the pattern in the above to create or update functionality to implement a user-profile service that allows a user to update their profile preferences. The user would be able to update 1 or more of display_name, avatar_gender, avatar_age_range, personalizationCountryCodes, timezone, preferred_reminder_time, notification_preferences.  The input profile values can be a value, or null, or undefined. undefined values are to be ignored, but null values must also null out the database fields.
Create the 

Make sure the service types are inferred but decoupled from the database schema. i.e. the service must not import anything directly from "schema"
```

#### Prompt 13.1
```
Can you reverse-engineer the work you just did for service creation or update, repository creation or update, dependency setup and injection, and exporting  into 1 or more AGENTS.md files that I can put in my project into the right directories or subdirectories to help make the tasks less ambiguous for the Cursor AI agent.
```

#### Prompt 13.2
```
Similar to the REST path comments on ChallengeService.getUserChallenge, add comments for the rest of the services that are missing REST paths.
```

#### Prompt 13.3
```
Add the "REST path" comment instruction to the services: AGENTS.MD
```

### Prompt 14
```
I'd like to create Svelte 15 APIs or Form actions to connect to the services defined in @services/   , I'd like to use a proper REST pattern as documented in each Service method and under the route path `/api/v1/` using best practices. "/api/v1" is a protected route , so you can be sure that authServices is not null and you can safely grab any service from there with the ! operator to remove the nullability.

Also, I'd like to use Zod to declare the request and responses models. 

Derive the Zod schemas from the dto input structure for each method and infer some meaningful validation defaults for each property based on its name or expectation. Make sure code is reused as much as possible, and also when types are extended e.g. type A = B & {...}, make sure the zod schema also reuses via schema.extend etc.

Tell me concisely how you will approach starting with UserProfileService and LogService, if I like the approach, I will give you the go-ahead to implement the rest.
```

#### Prompt 14.1
```
Ok, I like the approach. Start implementing service by service. Do no add any tests yet.
```

#### Prompt 14.2
```
Ensure to use the latest Zod documentation: @https://zod.dev/api 
```

#### Prompt 14.3
```
Add an AGENTS.MD for APIs under "/api/v1" directory based on the approach you just took
```

### Prompt 15
```
Create a new API to get the users profile. Tell me what you will do first in a concise manner
```
