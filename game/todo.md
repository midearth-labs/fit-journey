## Dependencies Summary
```
Phase 1 (MVP):
project-setup → supabase-setup → auth-system → database-schema
project-setup → project-structure
content-generation (parallel) → quiz-engine → scoring-system → social-sharing
content-generation → avatar-system
All core features → ui-polish

Phase 2 (Advanced):
ui-polish + social-sharing → pwa-features
```

## Success Metrics to Track
