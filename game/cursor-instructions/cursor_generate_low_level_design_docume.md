Design a low-level design document for each of the core components in @architecture.md  . Think like a seasoned and tenured Software Engineer and technical writer who is familiar with modern tools and design patterns. Use mermaid for diagrams.   Constrain the response to just low-level designs per component, don't go into specific business logic implementations.

Use @low-level-design-template.md template for your markdown output. Save the output for each component into the `game/design/low-level/{component-name}.md` directory.

Make sure all entities are accounted for and represented in each respective component output. 

For for any other important concerns not explicitly covered by the already defined core components, create a design document  for those and store the output a dedicated `game/design/low-level/important-others.md`. 

**IMPORTANT: **
Use Drizzle for SQL based  data entities and queries. Use Typescript types and compact logic for Static Content data entities and queries.
For API signatures, use Zod structures to represent the input and output and infer the Zod validation constraints for the inputs.

Execute this task component by component. Finish one and save it before you move on to the next one.

I'll design low-level design documents for each core component in the architecture. Let me start by examining the architecture document to identify all the core components, then create detailed designs for each one.

Let me first check the existing directory structure and then start with the first component.


Perfect! The low-level directory exists but is empty. Now let me start creating the low-level design documents for each core component. I'll begin with the **Content Management System**.

## Component 1: Content Management System

...

Great! Now let me create the second component: **Game Session Engine**.

## Component 2: Game Session Engine

...

Excellent! Now let me create the third component: **Streak Management System**.

## Component 3: Streak Management System

...

Excellent! Now let me create the fourth component: **Achievement System**.

## Component 4: Achievement System

...

Excellent! Now let me create the fifth component: **Avatar Progression System**.

## Component 5: Avatar Progression System

...

Excellent! Now let me create the sixth component: **Mobile Enabled User Interface**.

## Component 6: Mobile Enabled User Interface

...

Perfect! I have successfully created comprehensive low-level design documents for all the core components identified in the architecture document. Let me provide a summary of what has been completed:

## Summary of Completed Low-Level Design Documents

I have created detailed low-level design documents for **6 core components** and **1 additional system concerns document**, all stored in the `game/design/low-level/` directory:

### 1. **Content Management System** (`content-management-system.md`)
- Manages all pre-generated fitness knowledge content
- Handles content validation, versioning, and distribution
- Uses static JSON files with build-time validation
- Covers all content types: questions, passages, achievements, user states, avatar assets

### 2. **Game Session Engine** (`game-session-engine.md`)
- Orchestrates daily challenges and practice sessions
- Manages session state, question sequencing, and timezone handling
- Implements retry logic and performance tracking
- Uses state machine pattern with persistent storage

### 3. **Streak Management System** (`streak-management-system.md`)
- Tracks multi-type streaks across habits and quiz completion
- Handles timezone-aware date calculations
- Prevents streak manipulation through session timezone locking
- Manages milestone detection and streak history

### 4. **Achievement System** (`achievement-system.md`)
- Rewards user milestones through unlockable achievements
- Uses rule engine pattern with extensible unlock conditions
- Automatically detects achievement criteria
- Manages achievement display and reward distribution

### 5. **Avatar Progression System** (`avatar-progression-system.md`)
- Provides visual representation of user fitness state
- Automatically evaluates user state changes based on performance
- Manages avatar selection with fallback handling
- Tracks state progression and history

### 6. **Mobile Enabled User Interface** (`mobile-enabled-user-interface.md`)
- Ensures responsive design across all device types
- Implements PWA features and offline capabilities
- Handles touch interactions and mobile optimization
- Provides native app-like experience

### 7. **Important Others** (`important-others.md`)
- Covers critical system concerns not explicitly addressed by core components
- Includes authentication, authorization, data validation, error handling
- Covers logging, monitoring, testing infrastructure, and deployment
- Ensures system integrity, security, and maintainability

## Key Design Features

Each document follows the template structure and includes:

- **Executive Summary** with clear component purpose
- **Detailed Component Architecture** with Mermaid diagrams
- **Interface Specifications** using Zod schemas for validation
- **Data Design** with Drizzle for SQL entities and TypeScript for static content
- **Algorithm Design** with complexity analysis and business logic flows
- **Implementation Specifications** with concrete code examples
- **Error Handling & Validation** with comprehensive error scenarios
- **Testing Specifications** with integration and edge case testing

## Technology Stack Alignment

All designs properly align with the specified technology stack:
- **Drizzle ORM** for SQL-based data entities and queries
- **TypeScript types** for static content data entities
- **Zod schemas** for API input/output validation
- **Modern design patterns** (state machines, rule engines, event-driven architecture)
- **PWA features** with service workers and offline capabilities
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

These low-level design documents provide the technical foundation needed to implement the FitJourney game system according to the requirements and architecture specifications. Each component is designed to be modular, testable, and maintainable while following modern software engineering best practices.
