Update the low-level design document for "Game Session Engine" components in @architecture.md  based on the new requirements and entities updates. Think like a seasoned and tenured Software Engineer and technical writer who is familiar with modern tools and design patterns. Use mermaid for diagrams.   Constrain the response to just low-level designs per component, don't go into specific business logic implementations.

Use @low-level-design-template.md template for your markdown output. Update the component  details into the existing `game/design/low-level/{component-name}.md` directory.

Make sure all entities are accounted for and represented in each respective component output. 

For for any other important concerns not explicitly covered by the already defined core components, update the design document  for those into `game/design/low-level/important-others.md`. 

**IMPORTANT: **
Use Drizzle for SQL based  data entities and queries. Use Typescript types and compact logic for Static Content data entities and queries. Use jsonb.$type customizer for jsonb types.
For API signatures, use Zod structures to represent the input and output and infer the Zod validation constraints for the inputs.

I'll analyze the requirements and entities to create comprehensive low-level design documents for the Game Session Engine components. Let me start by examining the existing architecture and then create the detailed component designs.


Now I'll examine the existing game-session-engine.md to understand what needs to be updated based on the new requirements and entities.


Now I'll examine the requirements and entities to understand what needs to be updated. Based on my analysis, I need to update the Game Session Engine to properly handle the new requirements around timezone locking, session date handling, and the updated entity structures. Let me create the updated design document.

Perfect! I have successfully updated both the Game Session Engine and Important Others low-level design documents to align with the new requirements and entities. Let me provide a summary of what has been accomplished:

## Summary of Updates

### 1. Game Session Engine (`game-session-engine.md`)
- **Enhanced timezone security**: Added comprehensive timezone locking and validation to prevent manipulation
- **Session date handling**: Implemented `session_date_utc` field with timezone-aware boundary calculations
- **Updated entity structure**: Aligned with the new GameSession entity that includes `user_answers` as JSONB and removes separate QuestionAttempt table
- **Retry logic enhancement**: Added timezone validation to retry attempts and session date validation
- **Security monitoring**: Integrated timezone security monitoring with audit trails and suspicious pattern detection
- **New components**: Added SessionDateHandler for managing session date boundaries and timezone calculations

### 2. Important Others (`important-others.md`)
- **Added missing system components**: 
  - **Offline Data Management**: IndexedDB, LocalStorage, Cache API integration
  - **Sync Engine**: Queue-based data synchronization with conflict resolution
  - **Conflict Resolution**: Multiple resolution strategies (server wins, client wins, timestamp-based, user choice)
  - **PWA Service Worker**: Offline functionality, background sync, push notifications
  - **Timezone Security Manager**: Pattern-based detection and security monitoring
- **Enhanced security**: Comprehensive timezone manipulation prevention and audit trails
- **Offline capabilities**: Full offline data persistence and synchronization
- **Conflict handling**: Robust conflict resolution with user choice options

## Key Technical Improvements

### Timezone Security
- **Session-level timezone locking**: Prevents manipulation by storing timezone at session creation
- **Date boundary enforcement**: Uses UTC dates to prevent timezone-based cheating
- **Security monitoring**: Detects suspicious timezone change patterns
- **Audit trails**: Comprehensive logging of all timezone-related activities

### Data Management
- **JSONB integration**: Uses Drizzle's `jsonb.$type` customizer for complex data structures
- **Offline-first approach**: Comprehensive offline data management with sync capabilities
- **Conflict resolution**: Multiple strategies for handling data conflicts between offline and online versions

### PWA Features
- **Service worker integration**: Full offline functionality and background sync
- **Cache management**: Intelligent caching strategies for different content types
- **Push notifications**: User engagement through timely reminders and achievements

### Performance & Scalability
- **Queue-based sync**: Efficient handling of offline data synchronization
- **IndexedDB optimization**: Proper indexing for offline data queries
- **Conflict resolution caching**: Temporary caching of resolution results

These updates ensure that the FitJourney game system is robust, secure, and provides an excellent offline experience while maintaining data integrity and preventing manipulation attempts. The design documents now comprehensively cover all the requirements specified in the updated requirements.md and entities.md files.
