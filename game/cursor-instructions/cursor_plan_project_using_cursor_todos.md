Let's plan an approach to build out this project, think iteratively and not big-bang. Use the cursor todos planning approach with task-ids, checkbox placeholders and task dependencies etc

Create a todo.md using the Cursor planning approach @https://docs.cursor.com/en/agent/planning  , if you are not more than 85% sure about any of the task planning decisions you are making based on the already supplied information, clarify with me first. 

After you are done creating the list, I will review it manually, make some changes, and then ask you to start implementing the tasks based on the list and task dependency order

I'll analyze the provided documents and create a comprehensive todo list using Cursor's planning approach. Let me first understand the project requirements and then create a structured task breakdown.

I've created a comprehensive todo list based on the PRD and technical requirements. Here are the key planning decisions I made that I'd like to clarify:

## Planning Decisions I'm 85%+ Confident About:
1. **Phase 1 scope**: Core MVP with 3-4 game types, basic avatar system, and social sharing
2. **Tech stack**: Next.js 14 + Supabase + Drizzle ORM as outlined in structure.md
3. **Content strategy**: Pre-generated JSON files committed to repo (as specified)
4. **Task dependencies**: Logical flow from setup → auth → database → content → features

## Planning Decisions I Need Clarification On:

1. **Content Generation Timing**: Should we generate ALL quiz content upfront, or start with a smaller set (say 50-100 questions across 3 game types) to validate the system first?

2. **Avatar Complexity**: The PRD mentions "Visual States: Fit/Unfit, Healthy/Injured, Energetic/Tired" - should we start with just 2-3 basic states per demographic, or go for the full matrix immediately?

3. **Game Types Priority**: Which 3-4 game types should we prioritize for Phase 1? The PRD lists 7 types - I'm thinking Equipment ID, Form Check, Nutrition Myths, and Injury Prevention as the most engaging?

4. **Social Features Scope**: Should the initial social sharing be just screenshot + URL sharing, or do we need the full challenge URL system with friend comparisons in Phase 1?

5. **PWA vs Web First**: Should PWA features be in Phase 1 or can we start with a responsive web app and add PWA capabilities in Phase 2?

Please let me know your thoughts on these clarifications, and I'll adjust the todo list accordingly before we begin implementation.

1. Content Generation Timing: Smaller set of 50 questions per game type.
2. Avatar Complexity: 3 basic states per demographic
3. Game Types Priority: Equipment ID, Form Check, Nutrition Myths, and Injury Prevention, Body anatomy and movements
4. Social Features Scope: screenshot + URL sharing
5. PWA vs Web First: PWA should go in Phase2

Perfect! Thank you for the clarifications. Let me update the todo list with these specific requirements and adjust the scope accordingly.


Perfect! I've updated the todo list with your clarifications:

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Content Generation**: Scoped to 50 questions per game type (5 types × 50 = 250 total questions) and 3 basic avatar states per demographic
2. **Game Types**: Updated to include all 5 types you specified: Equipment ID, Form Check, Nutrition Myths, Injury Prevention, and Body Anatomy & Movements
3. **Social Features**: Simplified to basic screenshot + URL sharing, removed complex challenge URL system for Phase 1
4. **PWA Features**: Moved to Phase 2, allowing Phase 1 to focus on core game mechanics
5. **Dependencies**: Updated the dependency flow to reflect the new priorities

## Phase 1 Scope Summary:
- **250 quiz questions** across 5 game types
- **Basic avatar system** with 3 states per demographic
- **Core game engine** with scoring and progress tracking
- **Simple social sharing** with screenshots and URLs
- **Responsive web app** (PWA comes later)

This gives us a focused MVP that can validate the core concept while keeping development manageable. The todo list is now ready for implementation.

Would you like me to start with the first task (`project-setup`) to begin building the foundation?
