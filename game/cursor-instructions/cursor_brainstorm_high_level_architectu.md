Design a high-level architecture diagram to satisfy the requirements. Think like a seasoned and tenured Software Engineer and technical writer who is familiar with modern tools and design patterns. Use mermaid for diagrams. See @high-level-arch-template.md template.  Constrain the response to just high-level, don't go into low-level design or any coding. 

Make sure all entities  and existing technology choices are accounted for and represented in the output.

I'll design a high-level architecture diagram for the FitJourney game based on the requirements and existing technology choices. Let me analyze the documents and create a comprehensive architecture that satisfies all the requirements.


...

I've created a comprehensive high-level architecture document for the FitJourney game that addresses all the requirements and existing technology choices. Here are the key highlights:

## **Architecture Overview**

The architecture follows a **layered, event-driven pattern** with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Client Layer**: Web browsers, mobile browsers, and PWA apps
2. **Frontend Layer**: Next.js 14 with PWA features and offline caching
3. **Backend Layer**: Next.js API routes handling game logic, streaks, and achievements
4. **Data Layer**: Supabase platform with PostgreSQL, storage, and authentication
5. **Content Layer**: Static JSON content generated offline with AI tools

## **Key Architectural Decisions**

- **Pre-Generated Content Strategy**: All fitness knowledge content is generated offline using AI tools and stored as static JSON files, minimizing runtime costs
- **PWA-First Approach**: Built-in offline capabilities, service worker, and mobile app-like experience
- **Timezone Locking**: Session-based timezone storage prevents manipulation and ensures fair play
- **Event-Driven Streak System**: Real-time updates for achievements and state progression

## **Technology Stack Alignment**

The architecture incorporates all the existing technology choices:
- **Next.js 14** for frontend and API routes
- **Supabase** for database, authentication, and storage
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **Tailwind CSS** and **Framer Motion** for UI
- **Zustand** and **React Query** for state management

## **Data Flow Architecture**

The system handles two main data flows:
1. **Content Flow**: AI generation → Human review → Static JSON → Frontend
2. **User Progress Flow**: User actions → Game sessions → Streak calculations → Achievement checks → State updates

## **Security & Integrity Features**

- **Row-level security** through Supabase
- **Timezone manipulation prevention** via session locking
- **Data validation** at multiple layers
- **Audit trails** for user progress tracking

This architecture provides a solid foundation that can scale from MVP to enterprise while maintaining the performance, security, and user experience requirements outlined in the specifications.

what sections and files from the input source makes you conclude that the App will be offline-first approach?

Looking at the source documents, I need to correct my characterization. The system is **NOT** actually designed as an "offline-first" approach. Let me point out what the documents actually say:

## **What the Documents Actually Specify:**

### **From `requirements.md` (R8.2 - Offline Capability):**
```
WHEN the PWA is installed and the user goes offline
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow viewing of previously loaded questions and avatar status

WHEN the user comes back online after answering questions offline
THE SYSTEM SHALL sync all QuestionAttempt and progress data to the server
```

### **From `structure.md`:**
```
**Pre-Generated Content Strategy**: All knowledge base, quiz questions and avatar images are generated offline using AI tools, reviewed by agents/humans, and stored in database. No runtime AI generation to minimize costs and latency.
```

## **What This Actually Means:**

1. **Content Generation is Offline** - The AI content creation happens offline, not the user experience
2. **PWA Offline Features** - Basic offline viewing of previously loaded content, not offline-first functionality
3. **Sync When Online** - Offline actions are queued and synced when connection returns

## **Why I Incorrectly Characterized It:**

I mistakenly conflated:
- "Offline content generation" (AI tools working offline) 
- "Offline user experience" (users working offline-first)

## **Correct Characterization:**

The system is **"online-first with offline fallback"** - users primarily interact with the app while connected, but can view some previously loaded content when offline. The PWA features provide basic offline capabilities as a fallback, not as the primary interaction model.

I should revise the architecture document to remove the "offline-first" language and accurately reflect that this is a traditional web application with PWA offline capabilities as an enhancement, not a core architectural principle.

WHEN the PWA is installed and the user goes offline
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow viewing of previously loaded questions and avatar status

WHEN the user comes back online after answering questions offline
THE SYSTEM SHALL sync all QuestionAttempt and progress data to the server
```

**Pre-Generated Content Strategy**: All knowledge base, quiz questions and avatar images are generated offline using AI tools, reviewed by agents/humans, and stored in database. No runtime AI generation to minimize costs and latency.

Perfect! I've revised the architecture document to correctly reflect that the system is **not** offline-first, but rather:

## **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Architecture Principles**: Changed "Progressive Web App Native" to "Progressive Web App Enhanced" 
2. **Quality Attributes**: Updated "Offline-first approach" to "Offline fallback approach"
3. **Performance & Scalability**: Changed "offline PWA caching" to "PWA offline fallback caching"
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Updated to "offline fallback for content viewing"
5. **Executive Summary**: Clarified "enhanced offline capabilities" with "offline fallback for content viewing"
6. **Data Flow**: Changed "Offline Sync" to "Offline Fallback"

## **Correct Characterization:**

The system is **"online-first with offline fallback"** where:
- Users primarily interact with the app while connected
- PWA features provide offline viewing of previously loaded content
- Offline actions are queued and synced when connection returns
- The "offline" aspect refers to AI content generation, not user experience

This aligns with the actual requirements which specify offline content viewing as a fallback capability, not a core architectural principle.
