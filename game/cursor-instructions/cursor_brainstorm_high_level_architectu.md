Design a high-level architecture document to satisfy the requirements. Think like a seasoned and tenured Software Engineer and technical writer who is familiar with modern tools and design patterns. Use mermaid for diagrams. See @high-level-arch-template.md template.  Constrain the response to just high-level, don't go into low-level design or any coding. 

Make sure all entities  and existing technology choices are accounted for and represented in the output.

I'll design a high-level architecture diagram for the FitJourney game based on the requirements and existing technology choices. Let me analyze the documents and create a comprehensive architecture that satisfies all the requirements.


...

I've created a comprehensive high-level architecture document for the FitJourney game that addresses all the requirements and existing technology choices. Here are the key highlights:

## **Architecture Overview**

The architecture follows a **layered, event-driven pattern** with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Client Layer**: Web browsers, mobile browsers, and PWA apps
2. **Frontend Layer**: Next.js 14 with PWA features and offline caching
3. **Backend Layer**: Next.js API routes handling game logic, streaks, and achievements
4. **Data Layer**: Supabase platform with PostgreSQL, storage, and authentication
5. **Content Layer**: Static JSON content generated offline with AI tools

## **Key Architectural Decisions**

- **Pre-Generated Content Strategy**: All fitness knowledge content is generated offline using AI tools and stored as static JSON files, minimizing runtime costs
- **PWA-First Approach**: Built-in offline capabilities, service worker, and mobile app-like experience
- **Timezone Locking**: Session-based timezone storage prevents manipulation and ensures fair play
- **Event-Driven Streak System**: Real-time updates for achievements and state progression

## **Technology Stack Alignment**

The architecture incorporates all the existing technology choices:
- **Next.js 14** for frontend and API routes
- **Supabase** for database, authentication, and storage
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **Tailwind CSS** and **Framer Motion** for UI
- **Zustand** and **React Query** for state management

## **Data Flow Architecture**

The system handles two main data flows:
1. **Content Flow**: AI generation → Human review → Static JSON → Frontend
2. **User Progress Flow**: User actions → Game sessions → Streak calculations → Achievement checks → State updates

## **Security & Integrity Features**

- **Row-level security** through Supabase
- **Timezone manipulation prevention** via session locking
- **Data validation** at multiple layers
- **Audit trails** for user progress tracking

This architecture provides a solid foundation that can scale from MVP to enterprise while maintaining the performance, security, and user experience requirements outlined in the specifications.

what sections and files from the input source makes you conclude that the App will be offline-first approach? 

---

**Cursor**

Looking at the source documents, I need to correct my characterization. The system is **NOT** actually designed as an "offline-first" approach. Let me point out what the documents actually say:

## **What the Documents Actually Specify:**

### **From `requirements.md` (R8.2 - Offline Capability):**
```
WHEN the PWA is installed and the user goes offline
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow viewing of previously loaded questions and avatar status

WHEN the user comes back online after answering questions offline
THE SYSTEM SHALL sync all QuestionAttempt and progress data to the server
```

### **From `structure.md`:**
```
**Pre-Generated Content Strategy**: All knowledge base, quiz questions and avatar images are generated offline using AI tools, reviewed by agents/humans, and stored in database. No runtime AI generation to minimize costs and latency.
```

## **What This Actually Means:**

1. **Content Generation is Offline** - The AI content creation happens offline, not the user experience
2. **PWA Offline Features** - Basic offline viewing of previously loaded content, not offline-first functionality
3. **Sync When Online** - Offline actions are queued and synced when connection returns

## **Why I Incorrectly Characterized It:**

I mistakenly conflated:
- "Offline content generation" (AI tools working offline) 
- "Offline user experience" (users working offline-first)

## **Correct Characterization:**

The system is **"online-first with offline fallback"** - users primarily interact with the app while connected, but can view some previously loaded content when offline. The PWA features provide basic offline capabilities as a fallback, not as the primary interaction model.

I should revise the architecture document to remove the "offline-first" language and accurately reflect that this is a traditional web application with PWA offline capabilities as an enhancement, not a core architectural principle.

WHEN the PWA is installed and the user goes offline
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow viewing of previously loaded questions and avatar status

WHEN the user comes back online after answering questions offline
THE SYSTEM SHALL sync all QuestionAttempt and progress data to the server
```

```plaintext
**Pre-Generated Content Strategy**: All knowledge base, quiz questions and avatar images are generated offline using AI tools, reviewed by agents/humans, and stored in database. No runtime AI generation to minimize costs and latency.
```

Revise it

...

Perfect! I've revised the architecture document to correctly reflect that the system is **not** offline-first, but rather:

## **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Architecture Principles**: Changed "Progressive Web App Native" to "Progressive Web App Enhanced" 
2. **Quality Attributes**: Updated "Offline-first approach" to "Offline fallback approach"
3. **Performance & Scalability**: Changed "offline PWA caching" to "PWA offline fallback caching"
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Updated to "offline fallback for content viewing"
5. **Executive Summary**: Clarified "enhanced offline capabilities" with "offline fallback for content viewing"
6. **Data Flow**: Changed "Offline Sync" to "Offline Fallback"

## **Correct Characterization:**

The system is **"online-first with offline fallback"** where:
- Users primarily interact with the app while connected
- PWA features provide offline viewing of previously loaded content
- Offline actions are queued and synced when connection returns
- The "offline" aspect refers to AI content generation, not user experience

This aligns with the actual requirements which specify offline content viewing as a fallback capability, not a core architectural principle.

Add a section in @architecture.md for the "Core User Journeys"

---

**Cursor**

I'll add a "Core User Journeys" section to the architecture document. This section will outline the key user flows and how they map to the system architecture.

Perfect! I've added a comprehensive "Core User Journeys" section to the architecture document. This section covers the seven key user journeys that are central to the FitJourney game:

## **Added User Journeys:**

1. **User Onboarding Journey** - New user setup and first engagement
2. **Daily Challenge Journey** - Core daily quiz engagement loop
3. **Habit Tracking Journey** - Daily habit logging and streak building
4. **Practice Session Journey** - Category-specific practice sessions
5. **Achievement & Progress Journey** - Long-term engagement through milestones
6. **Offline Engagement Journey** - PWA offline capabilities and sync
7. **Social Sharing Journey** - Social interaction and challenge sharing

## **Key Features of This Section:**

- **Clear Purpose** for each journey
- **Step-by-step Flow** showing user progression
- **Architecture Impact** explaining how each journey affects system components
- **Mapping to Requirements** - each journey directly supports specific requirements from the source documents
- **Technology Alignment** - shows how the chosen tech stack supports user needs

This section bridges the gap between the technical architecture and user experience, making it clear how the system components work together to deliver the intended user journeys. It also helps developers understand the user context when implementing specific features.

Can the Mobile Enabled User interface be considered a core component also?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, absolutely! The **Mobile Enabled User Interface** should definitely be considered a core component. Looking at the requirements and architecture, mobile experience is fundamental to the system's success. Let me add it to the Core Components section.

Perfect! I've added the **Mobile Enabled User Interface** as a core component. This makes complete sense because:

## **Why Mobile UI is a Core Component:**

1. **PWA-First Strategy**: The requirements specifically call out PWA features as essential
2. **Mobile Engagement**: Fitness apps are primarily used on mobile devices
3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensures the same experience across web and mobile
4. **Offline Capabilities**: Mobile users need offline access more than desktop users

## **Key Responsibilities Added:**

- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to all screen sizes
- **Touch-Optimized Interactions**: Mobile-first interaction patterns
- **PWA Installation**: Home screen installation and app-like experience
- **Offline Content Access**: Critical for mobile users on-the-go
- **Mobile-First Design Patterns**: Prioritizes mobile user experience

## **Technology Approach:**

- **Progressive Web App**: Core PWA functionality
- **Responsive Tailwind CSS**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth mobile animations
- **Mobile-Optimized Component Library**: Touch-friendly UI components

This component is essential because it's not just about making the web app work on mobile - it's about creating a native app-like experience that users expect from fitness applications. The PWA capabilities, offline access, and mobile-optimized interactions are fundamental to the system's success and user engagement.
