Create a markdown file for the implementation roadmap/tasks and sub-tasks that you will implement step-by-step in order from top-to-bottom to satisfy the component designs of @content-management-system.md and @game-session-engine.md 

Think logically like a Senior Software Engineer/Project Manager in breaking down the tasks, dont worry about estimates and all as you Cursor the AI coding agent will be implementing the tasks as well. Think deeply about the  requirements scoped to those components and don't skip any. Link the tasks with its associated requirements so you can independently verify the definition of done. For any dependent tasks that are out of scope of the two designs, create a task to setup an interface contract for such dependency and stub with a reasonable implementation for now. 

Prefix the parent and subtasks with the brackets `[ ]` so the AI agent can use those to mark completion status later.

The end goal of this task is a meaningful plan that will enable the complete implementation of those two components.

I'll analyze the requirements and component designs to create a comprehensive implementation roadmap. Let me examine the documents to understand the scope and dependencies.


Now I'll create a comprehensive implementation roadmap based on the requirements and component designs.

I've created a comprehensive implementation roadmap for the Content Management System and Game Session Engine components. The roadmap is structured in logical phases with clear dependencies and requirements mapping.

## Key Features of the Roadmap:

### **Phase-Based Organization**
- **Phase 1**: Foundation & Infrastructure (Project setup, database schema, auth interfaces)
- **Phase 2**: Content Management System (All 4 core components with full implementation)
- **Phase 3**: Game Session Engine (All 6 core components with full implementation)
- **Phase 4**: API Layer & Integration (RESTful endpoints for both systems)
- **Phase 5**: Testing & Quality Assurance (Unit, integration, and E2E testing)
- **Phase 6**: Documentation & Deployment (Complete docs and deployment automation)

### **Requirements Coverage**
The roadmap directly maps to all relevant requirements:
- **R1.1-R1.4**: Database structure and static content generation
- **R2.1-R2.2**: User profile management
- **R3.1-R3.4**: Daily challenge system (core focus)
- **R12.1-R12.2**: Performance & analytics
- **R14.1**: Supabase auth integration
- **R15.1**: Activity tracking
- **CR1-CR3**: Cross-cutting concerns (error handling, validation, performance)

### **Dependency Management**
- Clear task dependencies prevent circular dependencies
- External system interfaces are stubbed with contracts
- Each phase builds upon previous phases
- Critical path identified for efficient development

### **Quality Assurance**
- Comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Performance requirements (<200ms for cached operations)
- Security measures (timezone manipulation prevention)
- Error handling and validation at every layer

### **Definition of Done**
Clear criteria for each component and the overall system, ensuring quality standards are met before moving to the next phase.

The roadmap enables the AI coding agent to systematically implement each component while maintaining code quality and meeting all functional and non-functional requirements. Each task is checkable and can be marked as complete, providing clear progress tracking throughout the implementation process.

Add tasks for Content generation using AI tools, these tasks should have breakdown that include Prompt Generation for each type of content to address "Static Content Creation", script generation to run against Google Gemini to generate the outputs (both JSON and Images) and save them into the respective files.

I'll add comprehensive tasks for AI content generation using Google Gemini. Let me update the roadmap to include these content generation tasks.


...

Perfect! I've successfully updated the implementation roadmap to include comprehensive AI content generation tasks using Google Gemini. Here's a summary of what was added:

## **New AI Content Generation Sections Added:**

### **Phase 2.8: AI Content Generation System Implementation**
- Google Gemini API integration and configuration
- Content generation orchestration system
- Error handling, retry logic, and monitoring

### **Phase 2.9: Content Generation Prompt Engineering** 
- **Detailed breakdowns for all 10 content types** with specific subtasks
- **ContentCategory prompts** for all 7 fitness categories
- **Question generation prompts** with difficulty distribution (easy/medium/hard)
- **PassageSet prompts** for reading passages with associated questions
- **KnowledgeBase prompts** for educational content
- **DailyChallenge prompts** with proper structure and difficulty distribution
- **Achievement prompts** for gamification milestones
- **UserState prompts** for fitness progression states
- **StreakType prompts** for habit tracking categories
- **AvatarAsset prompts** for visual asset generation using Gemini Vision

### **Phase 2.10: AI Content Generation Scripts**
- **Detailed implementation breakdowns** for all content generation scripts
- **Gemini API integration** for each content type
- **Content validation and relationship checking**
- **File organization and saving logic**

### **Phase 2.11: Content Generation Pipeline & Automation**
- **Batch content generation** with parallel processing
- **Scheduling and automation** capabilities
- **Quality assurance and performance monitoring**
- **Rollback and versioning** systems

### **Phase 2.12: Content Generation Execution & File Management**
- **Actual content generation execution** for all content types
- **File creation and organization** in appropriate directories
- **Content validation and integrity checking**
- **Comprehensive content generation workflow**

## **Key Benefits of the Updated Roadmap:**

1. **Complete AI Content Generation Coverage**: All requirements R1.2, R1.3, and R1.4 are now fully addressed
2. **Detailed Task Breakdowns**: Each major task has 5-10 subtasks for clear implementation guidance
3. **Google Gemini Integration**: Specific tasks for API setup, prompt engineering, and content generation
4. **Content Quality Assurance**: Validation, monitoring, and rollback capabilities built-in
5. **Scalable Pipeline**: Automation and batch processing for efficient content generation
6. **Proper Dependencies**: All task dependencies updated to reflect the new structure

The roadmap now provides a complete path for implementing both the Content Management System and Game Session Engine, with the AI content generation ensuring that all required static content is created using Google Gemini before the system goes live. This addresses the core requirement of having pre-generated, high-quality fitness knowledge content available for the gamified learning platform.
