Let's create a new file requirements.tests.md where we include tests for each requirement and ensure there is full coverage of documented behaviour. Derive additional edge/unhappy cases that I can review and accept. 

For example, avatar age range and gender are optional fields, include tests that ensure the profile setup doesn't fail when those values are not supplied, and that the values are validated properly when they are supplied. ALso, when attempting to display the user's avatar, ensure the validity of avatar profile data is used.

Think about authenticated features vs unauntheticated features. 

Think about the correct use of defaults e.g. for preferred_reminder_time and timezone.
Think about what happens when the user sets or updates their timezone.

Ensure test-cases refer back to their linked requirement ID.

Think deeply.

I'll create a comprehensive test coverage document for all the requirements. Let me analyze the requirements and entities to create thorough test cases that cover both happy paths and edge cases.

I've created a comprehensive test coverage document (`requirements.tests.md`) that provides thorough testing scenarios for all requirements. Here's what the document covers:

## Key Features of the Test Coverage:

### **Complete Requirement Coverage**
- **17 main requirements (R1-R17)** with detailed test cases
- **3 cross-cutting requirements (CR1-CR3)** covering error handling, validation, and performance
- **13 edge case scenarios (EC1-EC13)** addressing additional robustness concerns

### **Comprehensive Test Structure**
Each test case includes:
- **Test Case**: Clear description of what's being tested
- **Precondition**: What must be true before the test
- **Action**: What action is performed
- **Expected Result**: What should happen
- **Coverage**: Which requirement(s) this test covers

### **Addressing Your Specific Concerns**

#### **Avatar Age Range and Gender Validation**
- **Test R2.2.3-6**: Validates that valid values are accepted and invalid values are rejected
- **Test EC1**: Ensures profile setup doesn't fail when optional avatar fields are missing
- **Test EC2**: Validates avatar data combinations when provided

#### **Authentication vs Unauthenticated Features**
- **Test R2.1.2**: Ensures unauthenticated users cannot access protected features
- **Test CR1.2**: Handles authentication failures gracefully
- **Test EC6-7**: Covers session expiration and partial authentication states

#### **Default Value Handling**
- **Test EC4**: Uses default "UTC-7" timezone when not specified
- **Test EC5**: Uses default "19:00" reminder time when not specified
- **Test R12.2.2**: Shows "average" UserState when no current state is set

#### **Timezone Update Handling**
- **Test EC3**: Ensures reminder calculations update when timezone changes
- **Test R9.2.3**: Verifies reminders respect user timezone

### **Edge Cases and Error Scenarios**
The document includes extensive edge case coverage:
- **Data validation failures**
- **Network and offline scenarios**
- **Concurrent user updates**
- **Orphaned data references**
- **Performance under stress**
- **Authentication edge cases**

### **Test Coverage Summary**
- **150+ test cases** covering all documented behavior
- **Full requirement mapping** ensuring no gaps
- **Comprehensive edge case coverage** for system robustness
- **Authentication and authorization flows** thoroughly tested
- **Performance and offline capabilities** validated

This test coverage document will serve as a comprehensive guide for implementing and validating the FitJourney game system, ensuring all requirements are met and the system handles both happy paths and edge cases gracefully.
