Sarah stared at the gym cafe menu, completely overwhelmed. "I don't get it," she told Emma, who'd just finished her workout. "This protein smoothie has 40g of protein but also 50g of carbs. Is that bad?"

Emma smiled, remembering her own confusion months ago. "Not at all! After a workout, your body actually needs both. The protein helps repair your muscles, and the carbs refill your energy stores."

"But Instagram keeps telling me carbs are evil," Sarah protested.

"Instagram also tells people to do juice cleanses," Emma laughed. "Look, I aim for about 30g of protein per meal, plenty of carbs from whole foods, and some healthy fats. I stopped demonizing food groups and started feeling so much better."

Sarah pulled out her phone. "There's an app for tracking this stuff, right?"

"Sure, but start simple," Emma advised. "Just try to get some protein at each meal first. You can get fancy with exact numbers later."

Mike loaded his fifth scoop of protein powder into his shaker. His friend Jordan raised an eyebrow. "Dude, that's like 125 grams in one shake."

"Gotta maximize gains," Mike grunted, still sore from yesterday's workout.

Jordan, ever the researcher, pulled up an article on his phone. "Actually, studies show your body can only use about 25-40g of protein at once for muscle building. The rest just becomes expensive pee or gets stored as energy."

"But more is better, right?"

"Not really. You're drinking 500 calories of just protein powder. You could eat a whole meal with all three macros for that," Jordan explained. "Plus, where are your carbs for energy? No wonder you're dragging during workouts."

Mike looked at his shake skeptically. "So I should eat... carbs?"

"Your muscles literally run on glycogen, which comes from carbs. You're trying to build a house with just bricks and no mortar."
