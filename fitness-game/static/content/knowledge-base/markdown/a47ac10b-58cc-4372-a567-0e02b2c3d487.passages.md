Sarah stood in the gym's changing room, staring at her running shoes with newfound doubt. She'd just overheard two regulars discussing footwear.

"I used to wonder why my squats felt so unstable," the first woman said, lacing up flat-soled Converse. "Then someone explained that running shoes are like trying to lift weights on marshmallows."

"Wait, really?" her friend replied. "I've been wearing these for everything." She gestured to her cushioned runners.

"For cardio, they're perfect. But for weights? You want a stable base. I keep both in my gym bag now – runners for treadmill days, flats for strength training."

Sarah looked at the workout plan on her phone: cardio warm-up, then squats and deadlifts. She made a mental note to research cross-training shoes – something that could handle both without switching. For now, she'd make do, but at least she understood why her balance felt off during yesterday's strength session.

Mike tugged at his soaked cotton t-shirt, now heavy and clinging uncomfortably after just 20 minutes on the bike. Across the gym, he noticed another guy his age, equally sweaty but somehow looking... comfortable?

"Rough workout?" the guy asked, noticing Mike's discomfort at the water fountain.

"Just hot in here," Mike shrugged, embarrassed.

The guy smiled knowingly. "Cotton shirt? I made that mistake for months. Switched to moisture-wicking and it's a game-changer. You can get them cheap at any discount store – just check the label for polyester or 'performance blend.'"

"I thought that was just marketing," Mike admitted.

"Nah, it actually works. Cotton holds eight times its weight in water. These synthetic fabrics push sweat to the surface where it evaporates. Plus, cotton stays smelly even after washing."

Mike looked at his shirt with new understanding. No wonder he'd been so uncomfortable – and why his gym bag always smelled funky.

Riley stood in the athletic wear aisle, calculator app open, trying to figure out how to afford gym clothes on a student budget. An older woman nearby noticed their stress.

"First time buying workout clothes?" she asked kindly.

Riley nodded. "Instagram makes it seem like I need hundreds of dollars worth of stuff."

The woman laughed. "I've been working out for 30 years. You know what you really need? Two shirts, two bottoms, good shoes, and proper socks. Everything else is extra."

"But the brands—"

"Forget brands. This store's house brand uses the same moisture-wicking fabric as the $80 leggings. I buy the men's section t-shirts sometimes – they're cheaper and last forever. Spend money on shoes, save on everything else."

She pointed to the clearance rack. "End of season sales are your friend. Who cares if you're wearing last year's colors?"

Riley felt relief wash over them. "So maybe $100 total?"

"Less if you're smart about it. And wash everything inside out with vinegar – makes cheap clothes last way longer."
