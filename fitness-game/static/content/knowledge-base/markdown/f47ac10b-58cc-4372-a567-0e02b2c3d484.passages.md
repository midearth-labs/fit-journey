Taylor sat in the doctor's office, stunned. At 45, managing pre-diabetes and high blood pressure, they'd just learned about sarcopenia for the first time.

"You're already losing muscle mass," Dr. Chen explained, pulling up a chart. "See this? Without intervention, you'll lose another 15% by 60. That's not just strength—it's your blood sugar control, your balance, your independence."

"But I walk every day," Taylor protested.

"Walking is great for your heart, but it won't preserve muscle. You need resistance training." Dr. Chen showed photos of two 70-year-olds—one lifting weights, one struggling with stairs. "This is the choice you're making now, not later."

Taylor thought about their mother, who'd moved to assisted living at 72 after a fall. "What if I've never lifted weights?"

"Start with bodyweight exercises. Two sessions weekly. And increase your protein—your muscles are becoming resistant to it." Dr. Chen wrote down specifics: 30g protein per meal, squats, push-ups against a wall, resistance bands.

"Think of it as medicine," she added. "The most effective prescription I can write for your future self."

Sarah watched her 68-year-old mother struggle with a pickle jar, finally handing it over in frustration. "When did jar lids get so impossible?" her mother laughed, but Sarah heard the concern underneath.

"Mom, when's the last time you did any strength training?"

"Oh, that's for young people. I do my walking."

Sarah pulled up an article on her phone. "Look—grip strength predicts longevity better than blood pressure. And you can still build muscle at 68, even at 90."

Her mother looked skeptical. "I don't want to hurt myself."

"Start small. Remember Margaret from your book club? She started at your age. Now she's deadlifting."

"Margaret? Really?"

Sarah nodded. "She said something interesting—she doesn't strength train to add years to her life, but to add life to her years. No more asking for help with jars."

Her mother held the jar thoughtfully. "Maybe I could try those resistance bands you mentioned."

"I'll do it with you," Sarah offered, realizing she needed to protect her own future mobility too.
