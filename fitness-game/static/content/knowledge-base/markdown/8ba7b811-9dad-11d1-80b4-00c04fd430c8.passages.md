Jordan sat at the coffee shop, laptop open to the fifteenth article about goal setting. The notebook beside them was filled with crossed-out goals, each more elaborate than the last.

"Still planning?" asked Alex, sliding into the opposite seat. "You've been 'about to start' for three weeks now."

"I just want to get it right," Jordan replied, highlighting another paragraph about optimal training splits. "Should I focus on strength or cardio first? Morning or evening workouts? How many rest days?"

Alex pulled out their phone and showed a simple note: 'Gym: Mon/Wed/Fri 7am. 20 minutes minimum.'

"That's it?" Jordan asked.

"That's it. Been doing it for two months now. Sometimes I stay longer, sometimes just the 20 minutes. But I always show up."

Jordan stared at their complex spreadsheet with color-coded workout phases. "But what about progressive overload? Periodization? Heart rate zones?"

"What about just starting?" Alex shrugged. "You can optimize later. Right now, you need to optimize showing up."

Jordan closed the laptop slowly. "Twenty minutes. Three times a week."

"That's a real goal," Alex smiled. "Everything else is just procrastination dressed up as planning."

"New year, new me!" Casey had said that in January. And March. And again in September. Now it was November, and here they were, writing the same goals in a fresh notebook.

Their roommate Pat looked over. "Maybe try something different this time?"

"Like what? I always start strong. Two weeks of perfect workouts, then... something happens."

"What's your goal each time?" Pat asked.

Casey flipped through old notebooks. "Transform my body. Get fit. Workout every day. Eat clean. No more junk food."

"So basically, become a different person overnight?"

The truth stung. Casey nodded.

"What if this time, you just committed to twice a week? Just twice. For a whole month."

"That seems... too easy?"

"Exactly. Easy enough that you'll actually do it. You can always add more later."

Casey wrote in the notebook: 'Tuesday and Thursday. 15 minutes. Home workout. November only.'

"That doesn't look very impressive," Casey admitted.

"Neither does quitting every two weeks," Pat replied gently. "But showing up twice a week for a month? That would be your longest streak ever."

Emma pulled up another '30-Day Total Body Transformation' program on her phone while her kids ate breakfast. An hour per day, it promised. She laughed bitterly.

"What's funny, Mom?" her daughter asked.

"Just adult stuff, honey." Emma closed the app. Between work, kids, and life, she had maybe 20 minutes on a good day. These programs were designed for people with personal chefs and nannies.

Later, she called her friend Mike, who'd been working out consistently despite having twins.

"What's your secret?" she asked.

"Lower the bar until you can step over it," Mike said. "My goal? Three 10-minute YouTube workouts per week. That's it. Sometimes I do more, but I only count success as those three."

"Ten minutes? That can't do anything."

"It does more than zero minutes. And after six months, I'm stronger than I've been in years. Not Instagram strong, but real-life strong. I can carry both kids upstairs without dying."

Emma grabbed a sticky note: '10 minutes, 3x week, kids can watch.'

"That's not going to give me a beach body," she said.

"No, but it'll give you a consistent habit. Beach body goals are why you've started and stopped twelve times. This is why I've kept going."
