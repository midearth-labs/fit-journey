Riley stared at the nutrition app in frustration. Despite logging "everything" for three weeks and staying under the calorie goal, the scale hadn't budged.

"I don't get it," Riley complained to Alex during their study break. "I'm eating 1,500 calories a day according to this."

Alex glanced over. "Are you weighing your food?"

"I'm measuring it. A tablespoon of peanut butter, a cup of rice..."

"Measuring cups?" Alex pulled out a small digital scale from their backpack. "Let me show you something. Get your peanut butter."

Riley grabbed the jar and a tablespoon. After carefully scooping what looked like a level tablespoon, Alex had them put it on the scale. "That's 28 grams. The label says a serving is 32g for two tablespoons. So your 'tablespoon' is basically a full serving."

"But I leveled it off!"

"Peanut butter is dense. Even leveled, you're getting way more than you think. And that's just one food."

Emma had been meal prepping for months, but her containers were never quite even. Some weeks she'd run out early, others she'd have extras.

"Why don't you weigh them?" suggested Jordan, who'd stopped by while Emma was portioning out chicken and rice.

"Seems obsessive. I just eyeball it."

Jordan picked up two containers Emma had just filled. "Want to bet these are different amounts?"

Emma grabbed her daughter's craft scale from the homework desk. The first container: 385g. The second: 467g.

"That's like a 20% difference," Jordan calculated. "No wonder some days you're hungrier than others."

Emma started weighing each container, taking an extra three minutes total. The consistency transformed her weeks â€“ steady energy, predictable hunger patterns, and ironically, less time thinking about food since she knew exactly what she was getting.

Casey had been making the same smoothie for breakfast for months: "One banana, handful of berries, spoon of almond butter, cup of almond milk."

"That's pretty healthy," said Taylor, visiting after their morning walk. "How many calories?"

"Maybe 300?"

Taylor raised an eyebrow. "Mind if we check? I've been tracking for my diabetes management."

They rebuilt the smoothie, weighing each ingredient:
- "One" banana: 136g = 121 calories
- "Handful" of berries: 95g = 54 calories  
- "Spoon" of almond butter: 35g = 206 calories
- "Cup" of almond milk (measured): 240ml = 40 calories

"That's 421 calories, not 300," Casey realized. "The almond butter alone is most of it."

"Still healthy," Taylor assured. "But now you know why you're not hungry until lunch. That's a substantial breakfast."
