Taylor stared at the fitness tracker showing another night of broken sleep—4 hours and 47 minutes. "I don't understand," Taylor told the doctor during the checkup. "I'm doing everything right with diet and exercise for my pre-diabetes, but I'm not seeing results."

"How's your sleep?" the doctor asked.

"Who has time for sleep? I get up at 5 AM to exercise before work."

The doctor pulled up a chart. "See this? When you sleep less than 6 hours, your insulin sensitivity drops by 30%. You're literally undoing your morning workout by staying up late. Plus, your cortisol stays elevated, which promotes fat storage, especially around your midsection."

Taylor's trainer, Marcus, had noticed the pattern too. "You're the only client I have who gets weaker over time despite perfect form. Last week you couldn't lift what you did a month ago."

"But I'm putting in the work!"

"Your muscles grow during sleep, not in the gym," Marcus explained. "The gym is where you create the stimulus. Sleep is where the magic happens. Without it, you're just breaking down muscle without rebuilding it."

Casey stumbled into the kitchen at 2 AM, exhausted from another late-night study session but somehow ravenous. The leftover pizza called out like a siren song.

"Can't sleep?" asked Jamie, Casey's roommate, walking in with a book.

"I'm so tired but so hungry. It makes no sense," Casey groaned, already three slices in.

"Actually, it makes perfect sense," Jamie said, who was majoring in nutrition. "When you're sleep-deprived, your body produces more ghrelin—the hunger hormone. It's trying to get energy from food because you're not getting it from sleep."

"So that's why I always crave junk when I pull all-nighters?"

"Exactly. And here's the kicker—your body specifically craves high-calorie, high-carb foods when tired. One study showed sleep-deprived people ate 385 extra calories per day, mostly from snacks like... well, like that pizza."

Casey put down the fourth slice. "So if I just slept more..."

"You'd probably lose weight without changing anything else. Plus, you'd actually remember what you're studying."
