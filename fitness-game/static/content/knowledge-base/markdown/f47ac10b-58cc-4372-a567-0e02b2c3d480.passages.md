Sarah stared at her running shoes by the door, her chest tight with the familiar grip of morning anxiety. Her therapist had suggested exercise, but the thought of going to a gym made her panic worse.

"Just put them on," she told herself, remembering the therapist's advice about breaking things into tiny steps.

Ten minutes later, she was walking around her block, earbuds in, focusing on her breathing. Her heart was racing - but for once, it was supposed to be. As she picked up the pace slightly, something shifted. The racing heart didn't feel like panic anymore; it felt like power.

By the time she returned home, the vice grip of anxiety had loosened. Not completely gone, but manageable. She pulled out her phone and typed in her mood tracking app: "Before walk: 7/10 anxiety. After: 4/10. Same sensations, different context."

That evening, when her usual anxiety spike hit around dinner time, she noticed it wasn't as intense. The therapist had mentioned something about exercise effects lasting hours. Maybe there was something to this after all.

Mike slammed the weights down, his frustration evident. His comeback to fitness was supposed to make him feel better, but pushing himself to exhaustion was leaving him more stressed.

"You okay there?" Taylor asked from the next bench, moving through gentle movements with resistance bands.

"Just trying to burn off work stress," Mike grunted, loading more weight.

Taylor, managing both pre-diabetes and anxiety, smiled knowingly. "I used to think that too. Harder meant better, right? But my doctor explained that moderate exercise actually regulates cortisol better than intense workouts."

Mike paused. "But don't you need to push yourself for results?"

"Depends on the results you want," Taylor replied, finishing a set. "I'm exercising for my blood sugar and mental health. Twenty minutes of moderate work gives me 12 hours of reduced anxiety. When I go too hard, my stress hormones spike and my blood sugar gets wonky."

"So you're saying less is more?"

"I'm saying match your exercise to your goals. If mental health is one of them, consistency beats intensity every time."
