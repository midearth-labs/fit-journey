Sarah clutched her stomach during warm-up squats, regretting the protein bar she'd forced down in the parking lot. Emma noticed her discomfort immediately.

"Let me guess - ate right before working out because someone said you had to?"

"Instagram said I need fuel for my muscles," Sarah groaned.

"When did you last eat a real meal?" Emma asked.

"Lunch, like two hours ago. But I thought—"

"You thought you needed more. Classic mistake," Emma interrupted gently. "If you've eaten within 2-3 hours, you're fueled. That bar is just sitting in your stomach now."

"So I wasted money on these bars?"

"Not wasted. Save them for days you haven't eaten in 4+ hours or for after really long workouts. Or honestly, just as a snack when you're hungry."

Sarah stood up straighter, feeling slightly better. "What about after? Don't I have exactly 30 minutes?"

Emma laughed. "Girl, no. Just eat dinner when you get home. Your muscles aren't going to disappear."

Mike frantically chugged his protein shake while still dripping sweat. Alex watched from the gym lobby, amused.

"Dude, you know you don't have to inhale that immediately, right?" Alex said.

"Anabolic window, bro! Gotta maximize gains!" Mike gasped between gulps.

Alex pulled up a study on his phone. "Actually, recent research shows the 'window' is more like a garage door. You've got hours, especially since you ate lunch before coming here."

"But my bodybuilding forum says—"

"Your forum is stuck in 2005. Look, protein synthesis stays elevated for 24-48 hours after training. As long as you eat a decent meal in the next few hours, you're fine."

Mike looked at his half-empty shaker suspiciously. "So I've been stressed about nothing?"

"Pretty much. Plus, you're about to go eat dinner with your girlfriend in an hour anyway, right?"

"Yeah..."

"Then chill. Have your shake if you want, but stop treating it like a medical emergency."

Jordan stood in the kitchen at 5:45 AM, staring at a banana with analysis paralysis. Casey walked in, already dressed for their morning run together.

"Still debating whether to eat?" Casey asked.

"Every article says something different. Fasted cardio burns more fat, but eating gives you energy, but then digestion uses blood flow..."

Casey grabbed an apple. "Here's what I learned from trial and error: light cardio on empty stomach is fine. Intense workout? I need something small."

"How do you know which is which?"

"Easy test - can you hold a conversation during the workout? Then you can probably skip eating. Are you going all-out? Eat the banana."

Jordan considered this. "We're doing hill sprints today."

"Then eat the banana. Or at least half. Your body will thank you when we're on sprint number five."

"What about fat burning?"

"You know what burns fat? Consistency. And you can't be consistent if you feel terrible during workouts."
