Sarah was proud of her healthy breakfast routine – until she actually measured it. "I've been making these gorgeous smoothie bowls," she told her friend Emma at brunch. "Açai base, granola, almond butter, coconut flakes, chia seeds..."

"Sounds amazing! How many calories?" Emma asked.

"Maybe 300?" Sarah guessed. "The açai packet says 80 calories."

Emma pulled out her phone. "Let's check. The packet is how many servings?"

Sarah checked. "Oh... it says 2 servings. So 160."

"And the granola?"

"Quarter cup is 140 calories, but..." Sarah pictured her typical pour, "I probably use half a cup. So 280?"

"Almond butter?"

"Two tablespoons is 190." Sarah's eyes widened. "But I definitely use more like three."

They quickly tallied: açai (160) + granola (280) + almond butter (285) + coconut (60) + chia seeds (70) = 855 calories.

"That's not a bad breakfast," Emma said gently. "But it's good to know what you're actually eating."

Sarah nodded. "No wonder I wasn't hungry until dinner. I was eating two meals worth of calories thinking it was a light breakfast."

Mike stood in the convenience store, comparing protein bars for his post-workout snack. "This one's perfect," he muttered, looking at a bar advertising '20g protein, 220 calories.'

Jordan, browsing nearby, glanced over. "Check the servings."

"What do you mean? It's one bar."

"Yeah, but..." Jordan pointed to the nutrition label. "See here? Serving size: ½ bar."

Mike squinted at the tiny text. "Who eats half a protein bar? So this thing is actually 440 calories?"

"And 40 grams of protein, which is probably more than you need right after a workout anyway," Jordan added. "Your body can only process about 25-30 grams at once."

"This is ridiculous," Mike said, putting the bar back. "The front of the package should show the whole bar's nutrition."

"That's why I started making my own," Jordan said. "At least I know exactly what's in them."

Mike grabbed a different bar – single serving, 250 calories, 20g protein. "Better. But I'm definitely going to start checking serving sizes on everything now."
