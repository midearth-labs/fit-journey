Riley stared at the gym membership prices on the screen, calculator app open on their phone. "$80 a month? That's almost a thousand dollars a year!" 

Their roommate Marcus walked by, doing bicep curls with what looked like... a gallon of milk? "You know you don't need a gym, right?" Marcus said, switching arms. "This milk jug weighs eight pounds when full. Perfect for upper body work."

Riley looked skeptical. "But what about leg day? Cardio?"

Marcus set down the milk and grabbed his backpack from the corner. "Watch this." He loaded it with textbooks from the shelf. "Instant weight vest. I use it for squats, lunges, even weighted push-ups. Started with three books, now I'm up to six."

"And cardio?"

"Those stairs we complain about? They're basically a free StairMaster. Ten minutes up and down, and you'll be gasping. Plus, jump rope costs like five bucks, or just do the motion without one."

Riley picked up the milk jug experimentally. It did have a perfect handle. "What about all those machines at the gym?"

"Most machines just provide resistance," Marcus explained, grabbing a bath towel. "Watch—loop this around anything sturdy, and you've got cable rows. That chair? Perfect for tricep dips and step-ups. Your body weight plus creativity equals a full workout."

As Marcus demonstrated a chair-assisted pistol squat, Riley started seeing their apartment differently. The coffee table could work for incline push-ups, the couch cushions for balance work...

"Okay, but where do you store everything?"

Marcus laughed. "That's the beauty—it's all stuff we already use. The milk goes back in the fridge, books on the shelf, backpack in the closet. Zero extra storage needed."

Emma surveyed her living room during the kids' naptime. Twenty minutes until they woke up—no time for a gym run, even if she had a membership.

"Okay, YouTube coach," she muttered to her phone, "show me what you've got."

The instructor on screen held up a laundry detergent bottle. "Parents, you already have weights! These detergent jugs are perfect for rows and presses."

Emma grabbed her own—definitely heavy enough when full. The video continued: "Kids' toys work too. That toy storage bin? Fill it with stuffed animals for weighted carries."

She tried a set of squats holding her daughter's toy bin. Her legs burned pleasantly. This might actually work.

"For resistance training," the instructor demonstrated, "use your baby carrier or diaper bag. Load it with whatever weight feels right."

Emma's husband Tom peeked in. "What are you doing with Lily's diaper bag?"

"Weighted lunges. The instructor says parents' equipment is already functional fitness gear." She switched legs. "Remember complaining about carrying the car seat? That's basically a farmer's walk."

Tom grabbed a couch cushion. "My physical therapist had me do planks on unstable surfaces. Could these work?"

They spent the remaining ten minutes trying different exercises. When the kids woke up, Emma realized she'd gotten a decent workout without leaving the room or buying anything.

"Tomorrow during naptime?" Tom asked.

"It's a date. But you're bringing your own detergent bottle."

Jordan had spreadsheets. Color-coded spreadsheets comparing home equipment costs, space requirements, and exercise effectiveness ratings from three different studies.

"You're overthinking this," Alex said over video chat, already sweating from their workout. "I literally just started with water bottles and a towel."

"But the resistance curve of water bottles versus dumbbells—"

"Jordan. Stop." Alex held up a backpack. "Week one, I put one book in here. Week eight, I had ten books. Progressive overload achieved. Cost: zero dollars."

Jordan pulled up another spreadsheet. "But what about muscle group isolation? The unilateral training benefits of—"

Alex turned their laptop to show their 'home gym'—a corner of their bedroom with a yoga mat, two gallon water jugs, and a sturdy chair. "I've gained five pounds of muscle with this setup. My friend group does virtual workouts together three times a week. We all use different household stuff."

"Virtual workouts?" Jordan's analytical mind perked up.

"Yeah! Sarah uses paint cans, Mike has resistance bands made from bike inner tubes, and Chen does everything with a loaded suitcase. We keep each other accountable."

Jordan looked at their spreadsheets, then at their empty spare room. "The optimal setup would require—"

"The optimal setup," Alex interrupted gently, "is the one you'll actually use. Start with bodyweight and one household item. You can optimize later."

Jordan closed the laptop. Maybe the perfect home gym wasn't about equipment at all. They grabbed a water bottle experimentally. "Show me that bicep curl variation again?"
