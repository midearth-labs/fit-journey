Jordan stood in the break room, unwrapping his third 'healthy' granola bar of the day. Casey walked by and noticed the wrapper. "Those are your go-to snack, huh?"

"Yeah, only 100 calories each. Way better than candy."

Casey picked up the box. "Jordan, look closer. That's per serving, and each bar is two servings."

Jordan's jaw dropped. "Wait, so each bar is actually 200 calories? I've been eating 600 calories in snacks alone?"

"Plus, check the ingredients—sugar is listed three different ways in the top five ingredients. They split it up to make it seem healthier."

"So my three 'healthy' snacks are basically equivalent to a full meal?" Jordan looked at the wrapper with new eyes. "No wonder I haven't been losing weight despite 'eating clean.'"

Emma proudly showed Sarah her lunch. "Look, I'm finally eating salads every day! Tons of veggies, grilled chicken, and this lite ranch dressing."

Sarah glanced at the dressing bottle. "How much do you usually use?"

"I don't measure, but probably a good pour. The bottle says it's only 70 calories."

"Per tablespoon. And a 'good pour' is probably 4-5 tablespoons. That's 350 calories just in dressing."

Emma calculated quickly. "So my 'healthy' 300-calorie salad is actually 650 calories? That's more than a burger!"

"The vegetables and protein are great," Sarah reassured her. "But calories can hide anywhere. Try measuring your dressing for a week—you'll be shocked at how much you actually use. Or try lemon juice and a tiny bit of olive oil instead."
