Taylor sat in the doctor's office, slightly embarrassed. 'I want to start exercising, but I have pre-diabetes and high blood pressure. Is that... safe?'

Dr. Martinez smiled warmly. 'Not only is it safe, it's one of the best things you can do. But we need to be smart about it.'

'So I can't just jump into CrossFit?' Taylor asked, half-joking.

'Let's start with walking and light resistance training. I'll adjust your medication timing, and you'll need to check your blood sugar before and after exercise initially. Exercise is medicine, but like any medicine, we need the right dose.'

Taylor felt relief. There was a path forward, just with guardrails.

Casey was crushing the workout. The burning in the muscles felt like progress. But then, a sharp pain shot through the left knee—different from the muscle burn.

'Just push through it,' Casey thought, remembering all those motivational posts about not quitting.

Three more reps. The pain got worse. Finally, Casey stopped.

Two weeks later, still unable to exercise due to the injury, Casey reflected on the physical therapist's words: 'There's good pain and bad pain. Sharp pain is your body's stop sign, not a yield sign. Ignoring it doesn't make you tough—it makes you injured.'

Jordan had spent three weeks researching. Heart rate zones, VO2 max, optimal training windows, supplement timing—the spreadsheet had 47 rows of safety considerations.

'Have you actually started exercising yet?' Jordan's friend asked, looking at the elaborate planning documents.

'I want to make sure I do it safely,' Jordan replied.

'You know what's safest? Starting with a 10-minute walk. Today. You can optimize later, but you can't optimize what you haven't started.'

Jordan closed the laptop, put on sneakers, and walked out the door. Sometimes the safest thing is just beginning.
