Riley stared at the gym membership website. $79 a month, plus initiation fees. The budget spreadsheet was already in the red.

'Can't afford it,' Riley muttered, closing the laptop.

'Afford what?' asked Sam, Riley's roommate, doing squats in the living room.

'The gym. I want to get fit but...'

'I haven't been to a gym in six months,' Sam said, switching to lunges. 'YouTube workouts, water bottles as weights, backpack for weighted squats. Free and works great.'

Riley looked around their small apartment with new eyes. Maybe the gym wasn't a requirement after all.

Emma was always 'too busy' for exercise. Work, kids, household tasks—the list never ended.

'I don't have time to add anything else,' Emma complained to a neighbor while folding laundry.

'Who says you need to add anything?' the neighbor replied, doing calf raises while hanging clothes. 'I'm exercising right now.'

Emma paused, confused. 'Standing there is exercise?'

'Calf raises while doing chores. Squats while brushing teeth. I take the stairs two at a time when carrying groceries up. Wall push-ups while dinner cooks. I'm not adding exercise to my life—I'm finding it in what I already do.'

Emma looked at the basket of laundry with new eyes. Maybe fitness wasn't about finding time—maybe it was about using the time differently.
