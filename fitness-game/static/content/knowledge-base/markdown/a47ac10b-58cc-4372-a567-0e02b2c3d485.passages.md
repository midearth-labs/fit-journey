Jordan noticed something off about the lat pulldown machine. The analytical perfectionist in them kicked in immediately. "Hey, does this cable look weird to you?" they asked Mike, who was warming up nearby.

Mike walked over, his experienced eye catching it immediately. "That's definitely fraying. Good catch! I had a cable snap on me once—weight stack came crashing down. Scared everyone in the gym."

"Should we tell someone?" Jordan asked, already knowing the answer but wanting confirmation.

"Absolutely. And put an 'Out of Order' sign if they have one," Mike replied, grabbing his towel. "This is why I always do a quick check. Takes 10 seconds, saves potential disasters."

Jordan found a staff member while Mike fashioned a makeshift warning sign from his workout log. When they returned, Sarah was approaching the machine.

"Oh good, you saw our sign," Jordan said. "Cable's damaged. We just reported it."

Sarah's eyes widened. "I was about to jump right on it. Thanks for looking out!" She paused, then added, "Is this something I should be checking for?"

"Always," Mike and Jordan said in unison, then laughed. Mike continued, "Check cables, make sure pins are fully inserted, see if anything wobbles. It becomes automatic after a while."

"Like a pilot's pre-flight checklist," Jordan added, their analytical nature showing. "Prevents most accidents before they happen."

Emma watched in mild horror as someone finished their set on the bench press, leaving visible sweat marks on the bench, and walked away without wiping it down. She turned to Alex, who was setting up nearby.

"Did they seriously just...?" Emma whispered.

"Yep," Alex replied, already grabbing the spray bottle. "This is why I wipe everything before AND after I use it. You never know."

"That's smart. I've been trusting people too much," Emma admitted, helping Alex sanitize the bench. "What else should I be sanitizing?"

Alex went into educator mode—something they loved. "Everything you touch, but especially cardio handles, weight grips, and anywhere your head goes. Oh, and those adjustment pins everyone forgets about."

Riley joined them, overhearing the conversation. "Is that the gym's spray, or did you bring your own?"

"Gym's spray, but I carry hand sanitizer too," Alex replied. "Budget-friendly tip: a travel-size sanitizer costs two bucks and lasts a month."

"And saves you from whatever that guy left behind," Emma added, gesturing toward the now-departed non-wiper. "I'm definitely changing my routine now."

"Think of it as protecting yourself and others," Alex said. "When everyone does their part, we all stay healthier."

Casey was struggling with the barbell, having loaded it unevenly in their rush to get started. One side had 45 pounds more than the other, and as they lifted it off the rack, physics took over.

"WHOA!" Taylor shouted, rushing over to help stabilize the bar. Together, they managed to rerack it safely.

"Thanks," Casey panted, shaken. "I didn't realize—"

"Uneven loading," Taylor explained, their health-conscious mindset extending to safety. "More than 45 pounds difference and it'll flip. Learned that from my physical therapist after my back injury."

Mike appeared, having heard the commotion. "Everyone okay? I saw that bar starting to tilt."

"Yeah, Taylor saved me," Casey said gratefully. "I was rushing and not paying attention."

"We've all been there," Mike said kindly. "First rule of barbell loading: alternate sides when adding or removing plates. Second rule: always use collars."

Taylor pointed to the spring collars on the rack. "These things seem annoying, but they're lifesavers. Literally. I've seen plates slide off mid-squat—not pretty."

"Rushing leads to mistakes," Casey reflected. "I need to slow down and do things right."

"Better to take an extra minute than spend months in physical therapy," Taylor said knowingly. "Trust me on that one."
