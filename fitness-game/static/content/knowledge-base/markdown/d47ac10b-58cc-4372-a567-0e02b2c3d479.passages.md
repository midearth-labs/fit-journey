Sarah sat in her car in the gym parking lot for the third time this week. Yesterday, she'd made it as far as the front door before turning around. Her friend Mike, who'd been going to this gym for years after his own fitness comeback, had offered to meet her, but she'd declined—she didn't want him to see her struggle with basic equipment.

"The worst part," she'd texted her online fitness group, "is that I KNOW it's irrational. I know nobody cares what I'm doing. But my brain keeps playing this highlight reel of all the ways I'll embarrass myself."

Alex from the group had responded immediately: "I used to sit in my car too! Here's what helped: I set a timer for just 10 minutes. That's it. I told myself I only had to stay for 10 minutes, then I could leave with zero guilt. First time, I literally just walked on the treadmill facing the wall. But I did it."

Sarah looked at her phone timer. Ten minutes. She could do anything for ten minutes, right? She grabbed her water bottle, put in her earbuds, and opened the car door.

Jordan stood frozen by the weight racks, overwhelmed by the clash of metal and grunting around them. Their personal trainer, who they'd hired for just two sessions to combat this exact feeling, noticed the panic in their eyes.

"Remember the bubble technique we talked about?" the trainer said quietly. "Three feet around you in every direction—that's your space. Everyone outside that bubble? They don't exist right now. Inside your bubble, it's just you and these dumbbells."

Jordan closed their eyes briefly, visualizing the protective sphere. When they opened them, they focused only on what was within arm's reach: the 10-pound dumbbells, the bench, their water bottle.

"Better?" the trainer asked.

Jordan nodded, picking up the weights. "It's weird, but yeah. It's like everyone just... faded into background noise."

Casey, struggling with their own budget constraints and gym anxiety on the next bench, overheard the conversation. They made a mental note to try this bubble thing during tomorrow's terrifying venture into the free weight area.
