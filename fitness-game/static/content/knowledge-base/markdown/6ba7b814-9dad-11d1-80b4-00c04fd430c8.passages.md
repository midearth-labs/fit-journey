Taylor had been 'working through' knee pain for three months. 'It's just part of getting fit,' Taylor thought.

Finally, a friend insisted on a PT visit. The physical therapist watched Taylor squat once and stopped them immediately.

'Your knee is collapsing inward. You're putting massive stress on the joint. I'm surprised you lasted this long.'

Four weeks of corrective exercises later, Taylor was squatting pain-free with proper form.

'I wish I'd come sooner,' Taylor admitted.

'Everyone does,' the PT smiled. 'Pain is never just part of the process.'

Emma and Casey both wanted a trainer but couldn't afford $75 sessions individually.

'What if we split it?' Casey suggested. 'Small group training is like $30 each.'

They found two more beginners at their gym and approached a trainer together. Now they train twice weekly for less than a gym class costs.

'Plus, it's more fun,' Emma added. 'When I don't feel like showing up, knowing three people are counting on me gets me there.'

'And we check each other's form between trainer sessions,' Casey noted. 'It's like having four accountability partners for the price of a few coffee runs.'

Jordan had seventeen fitness apps, three workout programs printed out, and a browser with 47 open tabs about exercise.

'I don't know what's right anymore,' Jordan confessed to the gym's floor trainer. 'Every source says something different.'

The trainer spent 20 minutes—for free—showing Jordan three basic exercises and writing a simple program on an index card.

'Do this for four weeks. That's it. Ignore everything else.'

'But what about optimization and—'

'You can't optimize what you haven't started. Master these three moves first. The internet will still be there in four weeks.'

Jordan left with one index card and more clarity than months of research had provided.
