Jordan stared at the gym mirror, frustrated. "I don't get it," they muttered to their trainer. "You keep saying 'engage your core,' but I have no idea what that means."

The trainer, Marcus, nodded knowingly. "Let me try something different. Instead of thinking about your abs, imagine someone's about to playfully poke you in the stomach."

Jordan's eyes widened as their midsection automatically firmed up. "Oh! That's what it feels like?"

"Exactly. Now, for your plank – imagine you're a board that someone could use as a bridge. Not sagging, not peaked, just straight and strong."

As Jordan adjusted their position, everything clicked. Their back stopped aching, their shoulders felt stable, and for the first time, planks made sense.

"Different cues work for different people," Marcus explained. "Some need to 'pull their belly button to their spine,' others need to 'brace for impact.' The key is finding what makes YOUR body understand."

Sarah had been doing rows for weeks, but something felt off. She could feel it in her arms but never in her back where everyone said she should.

"Show me your form," requested Alex, who'd been training for years.

As Sarah demonstrated, Alex spotted the issue immediately. "You're pulling with your shoulders first. Try this – pretend you're starting a lawnmower, leading with your elbow."

Sarah tried again, focusing on her elbow path rather than her shoulder position. Suddenly, she felt muscles between her shoulder blades she didn't know existed.

"Also," Alex added, "imagine squeezing a pencil between your shoulder blades at the end. Not crushing it, just holding it."

The combination of cues transformed Sarah's rowing. "Why didn't anyone explain it like this before?" she laughed.

"Because everyone's brain processes movement differently," Alex replied. "Some people need mechanical cues, others need imagery. You just found yours."

Mike had been avoiding squats since his comeback to fitness. His old football coach's voice echoed: "Knees never past your toes!" But following that rule made him feel like he was falling backward.

Taylor, managing their own health conditions, noticed Mike's struggle. "You know that rule isn't universal, right? Look at my proportions versus yours."

They stood side by side. Taylor had shorter legs and a longer torso, while Mike was the opposite.

"Watch this," Taylor demonstrated a squat. Their knees barely passed their toes. Mike tried to copy the exact position and nearly toppled.

"Now try sitting back into an invisible chair, letting your knees go where they need to," Taylor suggested. "Keep them tracking over your middle toes, that's what matters."

Mike's squat suddenly felt natural and stable. His knees went slightly past his toes, but his weight was balanced and his back stayed neutral.

"Form rules are guidelines, not laws," Taylor said. "Your body knows good position when it finds it."
