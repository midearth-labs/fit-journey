Sarah stared at her food diary, frustrated. After six weeks of dieting, she'd lost 10 pounds but felt weaker than ever. "I can barely open jars anymore," she complained to her friend Emma at lunch.

"How much protein are you eating?" Emma asked, watching Sarah pick at her salad.

"Protein? I don't know... maybe 40 grams a day? I'm trying to keep calories low."

Emma pulled out her phone calculator. "Sarah, you weigh 70kg. You should be eating at least 110 grams of protein daily, especially while dieting. You're probably losing muscle along with fat."

"110 grams?!" Sarah's eyes widened. "That sounds impossible."

"Not really," Emma said, pointing at her own lunch – a chicken quinoa bowl. "This alone has 40 grams. Add Greek yogurt at breakfast, a protein shake as a snack, and salmon for dinner – you're there."

Sarah looked skeptical. "Won't all that protein make me bulk up?"

Emma laughed. "You're in a calorie deficit. Protein will help you keep the muscle you have, not turn you into a bodybuilder. Plus, muscle is what gives you that 'toned' look you want."

Mike, the former college athlete, sat across from Taylor at the gym café, both enjoying post-workout shakes. "I don't get it," Mike said. "I'm eating 1,200 calories a day, doing tons of cardio, and I feel terrible. Plus, I'm getting weaker."

Taylor, who'd successfully managed weight loss with pre-diabetes, frowned. "1,200 calories? Mike, you're 85kg and working out daily. That's way too low, and I bet you're not getting enough protein."

"I get some protein," Mike protested. "Breakfast cereal has protein, right?"

"Not enough. Let me guess – you're losing weight but looking 'skinny-fat'?"

Mike nodded reluctantly.

"Been there," Taylor said. "You're losing muscle along with fat. Try this: eat at least 170 grams of protein daily – that's 2 grams per kilo of your body weight. Create a smaller calorie deficit, maybe 1,800 calories. And add resistance training."

"But won't eating more slow my weight loss?"

"The scale might move slower," Taylor admitted, "but you'll lose mostly fat, keep your muscle, and actually look and feel better. Trust me, I learned this the hard way."
