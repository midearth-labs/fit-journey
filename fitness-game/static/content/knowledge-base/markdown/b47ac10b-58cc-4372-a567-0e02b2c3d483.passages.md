Jordan stood frozen in front of the squat rack, phone propped up for the fifth recording attempt. "My knees tracked perfectly that time," Jordan muttered, reviewing the footage, "but was my back neutral enough?"

Alex, working out nearby, noticed the frustration. "Hey, you've been filming for twenty minutes. What's up?"

"I'm trying to get perfect form before adding weight," Jordan explained. "I've watched dozens of videos, but I keep finding things wrong. My neck position, my knee tracking, my depth - something's always off."

Alex smiled knowingly. "I used to do the same thing. Here's what helped me: pick ONE thing to focus on per session. Today, just think about keeping your knees out. Don't worry about anything else."

"But what if my back rounds?"

"Then you'll fix that next session. Perfect form is built one piece at a time, not all at once. Plus," Alex added, "you learn more from doing 20 reps at 80% perfect than from analyzing 2 reps for an hour."

Jordan reluctantly loaded the empty barbell. "Just knees out?"

"Just knees out. Everything else will gradually fall into place."

Sarah was struggling through her third set of push-ups when Mike, the former athlete, walked by. Her elbows were flared wide, creating that classic "T" shape, and her lower back was sagging dramatically.

"Mind if I help?" Mike asked. "I used to make those exact mistakes."

Sarah collapsed gratefully. "Please! My shoulders are killing me, and my lower back feels weird."

"Your elbows are too wide - that's why your shoulders hurt. Try making an arrow shape instead of a T," Mike demonstrated. "And engage your core like someone's about to punch you in the stomach."

Sarah tried again with Mike's cues. The difference was immediate - less shoulder strain, more chest engagement.

"How did you know?" Sarah asked.

Mike laughed. "I ignored form for years when I was younger, thought I was too strong to need it. Then I got injured and had to relearn everything from scratch. Now I'm obsessive about form - it's actually why I'm progressing faster at 35 than I did at 25."

"So bad form was holding you back even when you were stronger?"

"Exactly. Good form isn't just about safety - it's about actually working the right muscles. Those ugly push-ups you were doing? Maybe 30% chest activation. These proper ones? More like 70%."

Casey was grinding through a set of deadlifts, back rounding more with each rep, when the gym trainer intervened.

"Let's drop the weight and reset your form," she suggested firmly.

Casey's face flushed. "But I did this weight last month!"

"And how long were you out of the gym after that?" the trainer asked pointedly.

Casey mumbled, "Three weeks..."

"Right. Every time you restart, your form needs attention before your strength comes back. It's not failure - it's smart training." The trainer removed half the plates. "Now, chest up, shoulders back, and push the floor away with your feet."

The lighter weight felt almost insulting, but Casey had to admit - the movement felt completely different. Controlled. Powerful. Right.

"I can actually feel my hamstrings and glutes working," Casey said, surprised.

"That's because you're finally doing the exercise correctly. Those heavy, sloppy reps? Your lower back was doing all the work. These lighter, perfect reps? They're actually building the muscles you want."

Casey finished the set, humbled but enlightened. "So every time I restart..."

"Check your ego, perfect your form, then build back up. It's the shortcut everyone skips that actually works."
