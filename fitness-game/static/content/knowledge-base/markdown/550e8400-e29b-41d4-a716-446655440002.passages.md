Casey stared at the nutrition app in disbelief. "800 calories for that smoothie bowl? But it's all fruit and granola!"

Riley, counting pennies at the same café, nodded knowingly. "I had the same shock when I started tracking. That 'healthy' bowl has more calories than a Big Mac."

"But fruits are good for you!" Casey protested.

"They are," Riley agreed, "but calories are calories for weight loss. That bowl has probably 2 tablespoons of almond butter, a cup of granola, honey, coconut flakes... it adds up fast."

Casey frowned at the receipt. "I've been having one every day thinking I was being healthy. No wonder the scale won't budge."

"Try making it at home," Riley suggested, pulling up a recipe. "Use Greek yogurt instead of acai base, measure the granola, skip the honey. Same satisfaction, half the calories, quarter of the price."

"You track everything?"

"Just for a few weeks until I learned portion sizes. Now I can eyeball it pretty well."

"Your blood sugar is still elevated," Dr. Martinez said, reviewing Taylor's lab results. "Have you made any dietary changes?"

Taylor shifted uncomfortably. "I switched to whole grain everything and cut out desserts."

"That's a great start. Are you tracking your total calorie intake?"

"Isn't that obsessive? I'm trying to be healthy, not develop an eating disorder."

Dr. Martinez smiled gently. "Tracking temporarily isn't obsessive – it's educational. Many patients are shocked to find they're eating 3,000 calories of 'healthy' food. Your body doesn't care if excess calories come from quinoa or cookies."

"But counting calories seems so... diet culture."

"Think of it like checking your bank balance. You wouldn't spend blindly and hope for the best, right? Just track for two weeks, no changes, just awareness. Many of my patients find that awareness alone leads to natural portion control."

Taylor pulled out their phone reluctantly. "Two weeks. That's it."
