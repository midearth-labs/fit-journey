Mike's first day back at the gym. Five years ago, he benched 200 pounds easily. He loaded 135 on the bar—a 'warm-up weight' from his glory days.

First rep: Shaky but okay.
Second rep: Bar barely went up.
Third rep: Needed help from a spotter.

'Start with just the bar,' the spotter suggested kindly. 'I've seen too many comebacks end in the emergency room.'

Mike's pride stung, but he stripped the weight. Four weeks later, working with light weight and perfect form, he was progressing faster than he ever did trying to force it. The tortoise approach was working.

Sarah and Jordan started their fitness journeys the same week. Three months later, they met for coffee.

'I went hard the first month,' Jordan admitted, nursing a wrapped knee. 'Six days a week, two hours each. Now I'm injured and haven't worked out in five weeks.'

'I felt silly doing just 10 minutes,' Sarah said. 'But I haven't missed a single day. Now I'm up to 30 minutes and feel amazing.'

'So you've exercised... 90 days straight?'

'Versus your 24 days total, then injury,' Sarah calculated. 'Slow and steady, right?'

Jordan's competitive nature finally understood: Consistency beats intensity every time.

Casey's trainer wrote a simple program: 3 exercises, 10 minutes, 3 times a week.

'That's it?' Casey asked, disappointed. 'I can do way more than this.'

'I know you can,' the trainer replied. 'But if you do the minimum consistently, you'll get better results than doing the maximum sporadically. Trust me.'

Six months later, Casey was still following the program—now evolved to 20 minutes, 4 times a week. Meanwhile, three friends who started with hour-long bootcamps had all quit by month two.

'How are you still going?' they asked.

'I never gave myself a reason to quit,' Casey smiled.
