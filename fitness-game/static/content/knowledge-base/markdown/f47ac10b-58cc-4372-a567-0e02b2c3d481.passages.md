Emma looked at her fitness tracker: 2 PM and only 1,500 steps. As a busy marketing manager and mom of two, her desk job was sabotaging her health goals.

"Another day chained to this desk," she muttered, feeling her lower back protest.

Then she remembered an article about 'exercise snacking' - tiny movement breaks throughout the day. She set her phone timer for 30 minutes.

When it buzzed, she stood and did 10 desk push-ups. Quick, simple, no one even noticed.

30 minutes later: a walk to the far water fountain.
30 minutes after that: calf raises during a conference call.

By 5 PM, her tracker showed 5,000 steps and her back pain had disappeared. Her colleague noticed her energy.

"What's different? You seem more upbeat than usual for a Tuesday."

"I'm taking movement breaks every 30 minutes. Want to join? We could do walking meetings."

Three weeks later, half their team was doing 3 PM plank challenges in the conference room. Emma's small rebellion against sitting had started an office movement revolution.

Jordan had planned it perfectly: gym at 6 AM, shower, work by 8. But the project deadline meant another all-nighter, and the 5 AM alarm was impossible.

"So much for that workout streak," Jordan thought, slumping at the desk at 8:47 AM, coffee number three already going cold.

Alex walked by, doing lunges down the hallway. "Morning workout?"

"More like morning movement. Missed the gym, so I'm doing exercise snacks instead."

"Exercise... snacks?"

"Yeah, watch." Alex demonstrated five burpees right there in the hallway. "Every hour, different movement. Sometimes squats, sometimes stretches, sometimes a quick walk. No perfect workout, just consistent movement."

Jordan watched, intrigued. "But doesn't that mess with your work flow?"

"Actually, I'm more focused after each break. My productivity's up since I started. Plus," Alex grinned, "my step count's higher than when I was just doing morning workouts."

Jordan glanced at the untouched coffee. Maybe perfection wasn't the answer. "Show me those burpees again?"

By afternoon, Jordan had done three 'exercise snacks' and felt more energized than any triple-shot espresso could provide. Sometimes the best fitness plan isn't the perfect one - it's the one you can actually stick to.
