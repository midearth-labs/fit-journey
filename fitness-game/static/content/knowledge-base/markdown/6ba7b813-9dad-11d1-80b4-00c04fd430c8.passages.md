Sarah stood at the back of the fitness class, completely lost.

'Okay, we're doing 3 sets of 15 reps, superset with mountain climbers, then AMRAP burpees for 30 seconds. Keep it at RPE 7!'

Sarah's face must have shown her confusion because the woman next to her whispered, 'Three groups of 15. When she says superset, do the next exercise right away. AMRAP means do as many as you can. RPE 7 means pretty hard but not killer.'

'Thank you,' Sarah whispered back, grateful.

'We all started somewhere. By next week, you'll be translating for someone else.'

Alex posted in the fitness forum: 'Can someone explain this workout? It says 5x5 compound movements, progressive overload, work up to 80% 1RM.'

The responses were surprisingly helpful:

'5x5 means 5 sets of 5 reps - it's a strength program.'

'Compound movements = exercises like squats and deadlifts that work multiple muscles.'

'Progressive overload = add a little weight each week.'

'80% 1RM = 80% of the max you could lift once. As a beginner, don't worry about this - just use a weight that makes the last rep challenging.'

Alex screenshotted the replies. The fitness community wasn't as intimidating as expected.
