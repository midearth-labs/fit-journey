Sarah stood outside the gym door, her new membership card trembling slightly in her hand. Through the glass, she could see rows of equipment she didn't recognize and people who seemed to know exactly what they were doing.

'You coming in?' asked a woman about her age, holding the door open. She had a normal body, was wearing regular workout clothes, and seemed... approachable.

'First day,' Sarah admitted.

'Mine was three months ago,' the woman smiled. 'I spent the first week just walking on the treadmill and figuring out where everything was. Nobody cared. They were all too busy with their own workouts.'

Sarah felt her shoulders relax slightly. 'Really?'

'Really. Start with what you know. Everything else can wait.'

Mike loaded the barbell with the weight he used to warm up with in college. First rep felt okay. Second rep was harder. By the third rep, his form was breaking down.

'Ego lifting will get you hurt,' his workout partner warned. 'I know you were strong five years ago, but your body doesn't remember that.'

Mike wanted to argue, but his shaking arms told the truth. He stripped half the weight off the bar.

'Smart move,' his partner nodded. 'Build back up slowly. Your muscle memory will kick in faster than you think, but only if you don't injure yourself trying to rush it.'

Emma looked at her schedule: work meeting at 9, school pickup at 3, dinner prep at 6. Where exactly was this hour-long workout supposed to fit?

'I do 10 minutes in the morning before the kids wake up,' her friend suggested over coffee. 'Just bodyweight stuff in my pajamas.'

'That counts?' Emma asked skeptically.

'It all counts. I've been doing it for six months. I'm stronger, I sleep better, and I haven't missed a single day because it's only 10 minutes.'

Emma thought about her unused gym membership from last year. An hour had felt impossible, but 10 minutes? She could do 10 minutes.
