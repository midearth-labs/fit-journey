Emma stared at the fitness tracker gathering dust on her nightstand. "Three hundred dollars of guilt," she muttered, picking it up for the first time in weeks.

"Still using that thing?" Mike asked from across the break room, noticing her fumbling with the charging cable.

"Trying to," Emma admitted. "But it keeps telling me my stress levels are high, I'm not sleeping enough, and my VO2 max is below average. Like, thanks for the confidence boost, watch."

Mike laughed. "Mine thinks I'm having a workout when I'm aggressively chopping vegetables. Yesterday it congratulated me on completing a rowing session while I was assembling IKEA furniture."

"So they're all useless?" Emma asked, considering whether to just sell hers online.

"Not useless, just... misunderstood," Mike said, pulling up his app. "Look, I stopped caring about absolute accuracy months ago. But see this graph? My average daily steps have gone from 3,000 to 7,500 over six months. My resting heart rate dropped from 72 to 64. Those trends? That's real progress."

Emma looked at her own app for the first time in weeks. "I have fourteen days of data from January, six from February, then... nothing."

"There's your problem," Mike said. "You're treating it like a test instead of a diary. Start with just one metric. For me, it was steps. Just steps. Every day, no matter what. Added sleep tracking after a month, heart rate after two months."

"But what about all these other features? Recovery scores, body battery, training readiness?"

Mike shrugged. "Ignore them for now. You wouldn't use every machine at the gym on your first day, right? Same principle."

Riley scrolled through fitness trackers online, calculator app open in another tab. "Cheapest decent one is still a week of groceries," they sighed.

"You know your phone tracks steps, right?" Casey said, not looking up from their own phone. "I've been using just my phone for six months."

"Wait, really? But everyone at the gym has those fancy watches."

Casey showed their screen. "Google Fit. Free. Tracks my walks, estimates calories, even attempts sleep tracking if I leave my phone on the bed. Is it perfect? No. Is it free and good enough? Absolutely."

"But how do you track heart rate during workouts?"

"I don't," Casey said simply. "I use the talk test. Can I hold a conversation? I'm in zone 2. Can I only grunt single words? Too hard. It's worked for decades before heart rate monitors existed."

Riley looked skeptical. "Doesn't feel very... scientific."

"Neither is spending $400 on a device that overestimates your calorie burn by 30%," Casey countered. "Look, I started with just my phone and free apps. MyFitnessPal for food, Nike Training for workouts, phone in pocket for steps. Total cost: zero. Once I proved to myself I'd stick with it for three months, then I bought a $40 Mi Band."

"And that works?"

"It tells time, counts steps, tracks sleep, and the battery lasts two weeks. What else do I really need as a beginner?" Casey showed the simple display. "The fancy analytics come later, if ever. First, just build the habit of moving more."

Jordan sat at the gym cafe, three devices spread on the table: smartwatch, phone, and a chest strap heart rate monitor. Spreadsheets glowed on the laptop screen.

"You planning a space mission or a workout?" Alex asked, sliding into the opposite seat.

"I'm trying to optimize my training," Jordan said, frantically scrolling through graphs. "My HRV suggests I need recovery, but my body battery is at 82, and my training readiness says moderate intensity is fine. But then my sleep score was only 67, though my recovery score is yellow, not red, and—"

"Jordan." Alex held up a hand. "When's the last time you just... worked out? Without checking any of this?"

Jordan paused. "I... can't remember."

"You've replaced actually exercising with analyzing exercise data," Alex said gently. "I did the same thing. Spent more time in spreadsheets than in the squat rack."

"But the data helps optimize—"

"The data helps when you have enough of it to see patterns. You need at least 4-6 weeks of consistent information before those fancy metrics mean anything. And even then..." Alex pulled up their own app. "See this? My watch says I need a recovery day. You know what? I feel great, so I'm ignoring it."

"Isn't that defeating the purpose?"

"The purpose is to be healthier and fitter, not to obey a algorithm that doesn't know I had two cups of coffee and a great night's sleep," Alex said. "Use the tech to inform your decisions, not make them. How do YOU feel today?"

Jordan considered. "Actually... pretty good. Energetic."

"Then let's work out. Leave the laptop here. Put the watch on 'Do Not Disturb.' Just move."
