Emma stared at her Sunday meal prep disaster – five identical containers of plain chicken, broccoli, and rice. "This is why I quit every time," she muttered.

"What's the problem?" asked her roommate Jordan, who'd been successfully meal prepping for months.

"It's so boring! And I'm never sure if I'm eating the right amounts."

Jordan grabbed a plate. "Forget the complicated stuff. Watch this." She divided the plate visually: "Half for veggies – mix it up with different colors and cooking methods. Quarter for protein – doesn't have to be just chicken. Quarter for carbs – try quinoa, sweet potato, whatever you like."

"That's it?"

"That's it. I prep components, not complete meals. Roast three different vegetables, cook two proteins, make two grain options. Then I mix and match all week using this proportion. Never boring, always balanced."

Emma looked at her sad containers, then at Jordan's colorful meal prep spread. "But what about macros?"

"This method automatically balances them. The vegetable half keeps calories controlled while providing nutrients. The protein quarter ensures you're getting enough for muscle recovery. The carb quarter gives you energy. Add a little avocado or nuts for healthy fats. It's basically macro counting for people who hate math."

"And this actually works for fitness goals?"

Jordan flexed playfully. "Three months of consistent eating like this, plus regular workouts. No calculators, no apps, no stress."

Mike studied the massive burger and fries in front of him, trying to figure out how to apply the Plate Method his trainer mentioned. Across from him, Taylor was rearranging their grilled salmon dinner.

"What are you doing?" Mike asked.

"Fixing the proportions," Taylor replied, pushing half the salmon to the side and asking the server for extra steamed vegetables. "Restaurant portions are backwards – huge protein, massive carbs, tiny vegetables."

"But I'm trying to build muscle. Don't I need all this protein?" Mike gestured at his burger.

"You need adequate protein, not excessive protein. That burger's probably 8 ounces – that's like three servings. Your body can only use so much at once for muscle building."

The server returned with Taylor's extra vegetables. "Could I also get a to-go box?" Taylor asked.

Mike watched as Taylor packed half the salmon and half the rice pillar into the box. "There's tomorrow's lunch. This way I get two balanced meals instead of one excessive one."

"But the fries..."

"Order a side salad with them next time. Eat half the fries, fill up on the salad. You still get to enjoy fries but in a proportion that supports your goals rather than sabotages them."

Mike looked at his plate differently. Maybe dining out didn't have to derail his fitness progress after all.
