Mike slumped onto the gym bench, confused and frustrated. "I don't get it," he told his workout partner Alex. "Last week I crushed this weight for 10 reps. Today I barely managed 6."

Alex glanced at Mike's empty hands. "Where's your water bottle?"

"Forgot it. But I'm not even thirsty."

"Dude, you're probably already 2-3% dehydrated. That can cut your strength by 20%. You're literally making every rep harder than it needs to be."

Mike's eyes widened. "Twenty percent? That's like... trying to bench press with a resistance band pulling the bar down."

"Exactly. Plus, see how you're sweating buckets? You're losing electrolytes too. No wonder you feel weak." Alex handed over his spare bottle. "Drink up. And tomorrow? Hydrate before you get here, not after you're already struggling."

Emma stared at her fitness tracker in disbelief. "Sarah, look at this. Same workout as two weeks ago, but my heart rate is 15 beats lower and I'm not even tired."

Sarah smiled knowingly. "What's changed?"

"Well, I started that hydration challenge you mentioned. Drinking half my body weight in ounces, plus extra for workouts."

"There's your answer. When you're properly hydrated, your blood is thinner, so your heart doesn't work as hard to pump it. Plus, your muscles get nutrients faster and clear waste products better."

Emma pulled out her marked water bottle. "I thought the time markers were silly, but they really work. I drink 20 ounces by 10am, another 20 by noon..."

"And now you're crushing workouts instead of them crushing you," Sarah finished. "Hydration is basically a legal performance enhancer that people ignore because it's too simple."
