Casey stared at the gym membership cancellation form for the third time this year. Another failed attempt at fitnessâ€”the pattern was always the same. Monday's two-hour workout left them unable to walk properly until Thursday.

"Maybe I'm just not cut out for this," Casey muttered.

"Hold up," said Alex, their workout buddy. "What if you're just doing it wrong? Look, I come here four times a week, but I never stay more than 30 minutes."

Casey laughed. "That's barely a warmup according to Instagram."

"Instagram isn't paying my medical bills or living in my body," Alex replied. "I've been doing this for two years straight. Never missed more than one day in a row. You've been here what, six times in three months?"

The math was embarrassing but enlightening. Casey's all-or-nothing approach had resulted in almost nothing.

Emma looked at her workout clothes still folded from Monday. It was now Wednesday evening, and between her daughter's soccer practice and a work deadline, exercise had fallen off the radar.

"Mommy, why do you have your exercise clothes but you're not exercising?" her six-year-old asked with that brutal honesty only children possess.

Emma remembered her new rule: never two days without movement. She'd already missed Tuesday.

"You know what? You're right. Want to do a dance video with me? Just 15 minutes?"

Fifteen minutes wasn't her planned 45-minute workout, but it was something. And something was infinitely better than nothing. Plus, her daughter's giggles during the workout made it the highlight of her week.
