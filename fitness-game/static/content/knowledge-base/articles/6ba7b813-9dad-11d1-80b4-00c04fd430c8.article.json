  "body": "# Fitness Language Decoded: From Reps to RIR Without the Confusion\n\nEver felt like fitness people speak a different language? They do. But it's not as complicated as it sounds. Today, we're translating gym-speak into human-speak, so you'll never feel lost in a conversation about working out again.\n\n## The Essential Dictionary\n\n### Reps and Sets: The Basic Building Blocks\n\n**Rep (Repetition):** One complete movement\n- 1 squat = 1 rep\n- 1 push-up = 1 rep\n- Lifting weight up and down once = 1 rep\n\n**Set:** A group of reps done without stopping\n- 10 push-ups in a row = 1 set of 10 reps\n- Rest\n- 10 more push-ups = 2nd set of 10 reps\n\n**Written as:** 3×10 or 3 sets of 10 reps\n\n![Reps and sets visual](/images/knowledge-base/6ba7b813-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8/reps-sets-visual.png)\n\n### The Intensity Indicators\n\n**RIR (Reps in Reserve):** How many more reps you could do\n- RIR 3 = Stop when you could do 3 more\n- RIR 1 = Stop when you could do 1 more\n- RIR 0 = Can't do another rep (muscle failure)\n\n**RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion):** How hard it feels (1-10 scale)\n- RPE 1-3: Easy conversation pace\n- RPE 4-6: Somewhat hard, can talk in sentences\n- RPE 7-8: Hard, only short phrases\n- RPE 9-10: Maximum effort, can't talk\n\n**1RM (One Rep Max):** The maximum weight you can lift once\n- Mostly theoretical for beginners\n- Used to calculate training weights\n- Example: If 1RM = 100 lbs, 70% = 70 lbs for training\n\n### The Movement Categories\n\n**Compound Exercises:** Multiple muscle groups, multiple joints\n- Squats (legs, glutes, core)\n- Push-ups (chest, shoulders, triceps)\n- Deadlifts (everything)\n- Pull-ups (back, biceps)\n- *Best bang for your buck*\n\n**Isolation Exercises:** One muscle group, one joint\n- Bicep curls (just biceps)\n- Leg extensions (just quads)\n- Calf raises (just calves)\n- *Good for targeting weak points*\n\n![Compound vs isolation](/images/knowledge-base/6ba7b813-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8/compound-isolation.png)\n\n### The Tempo Talk\n\n**Eccentric:** The lowering/lengthening phase\n- Lowering into a squat\n- Lowering the weight down\n- The 'negative' portion\n- *Where most muscle damage (good) occurs*\n\n**Concentric:** The lifting/shortening phase\n- Standing up from squat\n- Pushing weight up\n- The 'positive' portion\n- *The actual 'work' phase*\n\n**Isometric:** Holding still under tension\n- Plank position\n- Wall sit\n- Pausing mid-rep\n- *Builds strength at specific positions*\n\n**Tempo notation:** 3-1-2-0\n- 3 seconds down (eccentric)\n- 1 second pause at bottom\n- 2 seconds up (concentric)\n- 0 second pause at top\n\n### The Body Part Breakdown\n\n**Push Muscles:** Chest, shoulders, triceps\n- Used in pushing movements\n- Push-ups, overhead press, dips\n\n**Pull Muscles:** Back, biceps\n- Used in pulling movements\n- Rows, pull-ups, curls\n\n**Legs:** Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves\n- Quads = front of thigh\n- Hamstrings = back of thigh\n- Glutes = butt muscles\n- Calves = lower leg\n\n**Core:** Abs, obliques, lower back\n- Not just 'six-pack' muscles\n- Includes entire midsection\n- Stabilizes everything\n\n### The Recovery Terminology\n\n**DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness):** The soreness 24-48 hours after\n- Normal, especially when new\n- Not an injury indicator\n- Decreases as you adapt\n- Doesn't mean better workout\n\n**Active Recovery:** Light movement on rest days\n- Walking, easy cycling\n- Gentle yoga\n- Helps reduce soreness\n- Not another workout\n\n**Deload Week:** Planned easy week\n- 50% normal intensity\n- Allows full recovery\n- Prevents burnout\n- Usually every 4-6 weeks\n\n![Recovery terminology](/images/knowledge-base/6ba7b813-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8/recovery-terms.png)\n\n## The Training Styles Explained\n\n### Strength Training\n**What it is:** Lifting weights or resistance to build muscle/strength\n**Looks like:** Dumbbells, barbells, machines, bodyweight\n**Benefits:** Muscle, bone density, metabolism boost\n\n### Cardio (Cardiovascular Training)\n**What it is:** Exercise that raises heart rate for extended time\n**Looks like:** Running, cycling, swimming, dancing\n**Types:**\n- **LISS (Low Intensity Steady State):** Easy pace you can maintain\n- **HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training):** Short bursts of hard work + rest\n- **MISS (Moderate Intensity Steady State):** Middle ground\n\n### Functional Training\n**What it is:** Movements that help real-life activities\n**Looks like:** Carrying, lifting, rotating, balancing\n**Example:** Farmer's walks = carrying groceries\n\n### Mobility vs Flexibility\n**Flexibility:** How far a joint can move passively\n**Mobility:** How well you control movement through range\n**Think:** Flexibility = can touch toes, Mobility = can control the movement\n\n## The Nutrition Nomenclature\n\n### Macros (Macronutrients)\nThe big three nutrients:\n- **Protein:** 4 calories per gram (builds/repairs muscle)\n- **Carbs:** 4 calories per gram (primary energy)\n- **Fats:** 9 calories per gram (hormones, absorption)\n\n### Common Terms\n**Deficit:** Eating fewer calories than you burn (weight loss)\n**Surplus:** Eating more calories than you burn (weight/muscle gain)\n**Maintenance:** Eating equal to what you burn (weight stability)\n**Refeed:** Planned higher calorie day\n**Cheat Meal:** Unplanned indulgence (not recommended terminology)\n\n## The Equipment Encyclopedia\n\n### Free Weights\n**Dumbbells:** Handheld weights, one per hand\n**Barbells:** Long bar with weights on ends\n**Kettlebells:** Cannonball with handle\n**Plates:** The circular weights added to bars\n\n### Machines\n**Cable Machines:** Adjustable pulleys with weight stacks\n**Smith Machine:** Barbell on guided rails\n**Leg Press:** Push weight with legs while seated\n**Lat Pulldown:** Pull bar down from above\n\n### Accessories\n**Resistance Bands:** Elastic bands for resistance\n**Foam Roller:** Self-massage cylinder\n**Straps:** Help grip when hands tire\n**Belt:** Supports core during heavy lifts\n\n![Equipment types](/images/knowledge-base/6ba7b813-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8/equipment-guide.png)\n\n## The Acronym Assault\n\n**AMRAP:** As Many Reps/Rounds As Possible\n**EMOM:** Every Minute On the Minute\n**WOD:** Workout Of the Day\n**PR/PB:** Personal Record/Personal Best\n**BW:** Body Weight\n**DB:** Dumbbell\n**BB:** Barbell\n**KB:** Kettlebell\n**TUT:** Time Under Tension\n\n## The Form Phrases\n\n**Neutral Spine:** Natural back position, not arched or rounded\n**Hip Hinge:** Bending at hips, not waist\n**Bracing:** Tightening core as if about to be punched\n**Mind-Muscle Connection:** Focusing on feeling target muscle work\n**Full ROM:** Full Range of Motion\n**Lockout:** Full extension of joint\n**Sticking Point:** Hardest part of movement\n\n## Common Conversations Decoded\n\n### \"What's your split?\"\nTranslation: How do you divide your training days?\nAnswers: \n- \"Upper/Lower\" (alternating days)\n- \"Push/Pull/Legs\" (3-day rotation)\n- \"Full body\" (everything each session)\n\n### \"How much do you bench?\"\nTranslation: Common strength benchmark question\nGood response: \"I'm focusing on form right now\"\n\n### \"Are you cutting or bulking?\"\nTranslation: Are you trying to lose fat or gain muscle?\nBeginner response: \"I'm just building healthy habits first\"\n\n### \"What's your max?\"\nTranslation: What's the most weight you can lift once?\nHonest response: \"Haven't tested it, working on consistency\"\n\n## The Social Media vs Reality Check\n\n**\"Shredded\"** = Very low body fat (often unsustainable)\n**\"Gains\"** = Muscle growth (takes months/years)\n**\"Beast Mode\"** = Training very hard (usually unnecessary)\n**\"No Days Off\"** = Bad advice (rest is crucial)\n**\"Natty\"** = Natural, no steroids (often debated)\n\n## Your Translator Toolkit\n\n### When someone says → They mean:\n\"Superset\" → Do two exercises back-to-back\n\"Drop set\" → Reduce weight when tired, keep going\n\"Working set\" → The challenging sets, not warm-up\n\"Spot me\" → Help if I can't finish the rep\n\"Work in?\" → Can we share this equipment?\n\n### When instructions say → Do this:\n\"To failure\" → Until you can't do another with good form\n\"Controlled tempo\" → Slow and deliberate, not rushed\n\"Squeeze at the top\" → Pause and contract muscle\n\"Stretch at the bottom\" → Feel the muscle lengthen\n\"Keep tension\" → Don't fully relax between reps\n\n## The Confidence Builder\n\nNow when someone says: \"I did 3 sets of 12 reps at RPE 8 with 2 RIR on my compound movements during my upper body day,\" you know they mean:\n\n\"I did 3 groups of 12 repetitions at a pretty hard intensity level (could have done 2 more reps) on exercises that work multiple muscles during my chest/back/arms workout day.\"\n\nSee? Not so complicated.\n\n## Your Communication Cheat Sheet\n\n### At the gym:\n- \"Are you using this?\" (Before taking equipment)\n- \"How many sets left?\" (To gauge wait time)\n- \"Can you spot me?\" (Need safety help)\n- \"Mind if I work in?\" (Share equipment between sets)\n\n### With trainers:\n- \"Can you check my form?\" (Ensure safety)\n- \"What muscle should I feel?\" (Verify correct execution)\n- \"Can I modify this?\" (If something hurts/feels wrong)\n\n### Online:\n- \"Form check?\" (Asking for technique feedback)\n- \"Beginner routine?\" (Need simple program)\n- \"Progressive overload?\" (How to improve over time)\n\nTomorrow, we'll explore when to go solo versus when to get professional help. But today, you've gained the power to understand and participate in fitness conversations without feeling lost. Welcome to the community—you now speak the language!",
